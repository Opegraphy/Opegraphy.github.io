South Sudan vice president suggests firing squad to end corruption,"One of South Sudan's vice presidents, Taban Deng Gai, has suggested executing people involved in corruption cases by firing squad as a way to end this crime in the country, the Europa Press news agency reported on Tuesday.","One of South Sudan's vice-presidents, Taban Deng Gai, has suggested executing people involved in corruption cases by firing squad as a way to end this crime in the country, the Europa Press news agency reported on Tuesday. According to figures presented by Gai, who is responsible for energy matters, 350 complaints have been filed regarding cases of electricity theft, although ""only two have reached the courts"", something he attributed to corruption among the security forces and the judiciary, as reported by the South Sudanese news station Eye Radio. ""The company said that if the problem is not resolved, it could collapse and close its doors,"" warned Gai, who called for action to end this type of criminal behavior. ""There are serious discussions about how to end corruption. We should think about firing squads,"" he said. The comments by the vice president of South Sudan, which is in the midst of a severe humanitarian crisis, come as there are allegations that engineers helped some residents sabotage utility poles to obtain irregular services. The African country, which is struggling with severe power shortages, is also in the midst of a serious political crisis following fighting in February between the army and a militia in Upper Nile, near the border with Ethiopia, especially after the government accused the opposition Sudan People’s Liberation Movement – ​​Opposition (SPLM-IO) of allegedly supporting the group, an accusation the SPLM-IO has repeatedly denied. The accusations eventually led to the placement under house arrest of former rebel leader and current First Vice President Riek Machar, who was subsequently replaced as interim head of the SPLM-IO, also causing an internal split within the opposition group and threatening further instability amid fears of a possible collapse of the 2018 peace deal.",https://www.noticiasaominuto.com/mundo/2776313/vice-presidente-do-sudao-do-sul-sugere-fuzilamento-para-acabar-com-corrupcao,noticiasaominuto.com,"Tue, 29 Apr 2025 17:38:49 GMT"

April 29, 2025

While gender-based violence, including aggressions of a sexual nature, impacts women and girls across the globe, those living in societies that are more male-dominated than others run a significantly higher risk of being subjected to such violations. 
In South Sudan and other countries experiencing a conflict or post-conflict context, they are particularly vulnerable. Recognizing the devastating effects of this plague, Eastern Equatoria State has taken decisive action by establishing a taskforce dedicated to addressing and coordinating efforts to combat both gender-based violence and conflict-related sexual violence. 
“We all have a moral obligation to stop all forms of violence against women and girls,” asserts Mikelina Emilio, a Gender Affairs Officer serving with the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS), whose support has been instrumental to the creation of the new and inclusive body. 
Comprising 50 members, the taskforce includes representatives from government institutions, UN agencies, women-led networks, faith-based groups, youth unions, civil society and international organizations. It is committed to using their collective and complementary experiences and skills strength to develop strategies to tackle harmful cultural practices contributing to putting women and girls at risk of sexual and other forms of violence. 
A propensity to deny girls the right to education, not least by condoning their early and often forced marriages and thus keeping them at home, is one such negative, gender-biased practice. So called blood compensation, where the family of an informally convicted murderer offers a girl or woman as a kind of “payment” to the relatives of the victim, is another. 
Both phenomena reflect and reinforce a view of women and girls as objects, assets and property rather than individuals with the same rights and entitlements as men and boys. 
“It is our collective role and responsibility as stakeholders to work together to put an end to all forms of gender-based violence, and that is why we are here,” said Jennifer Nabongorika, the state’s Minister of Gender, Child and Social Welfare, who added that making efforts to hold perpetrators of violations accountable and providing adequate support to survivors will be important aspects of the work of the taskforce. 
The origin of the Eastern Equatorian initiative can be traced back to 2023, when the peacekeeping mission and the national Ministry of Gender, Child and Social Welfare hosted a forum to discuss methods to address sexual and other forms of gender-based violence. 
A thorough analysis of trends and challenges related to the issue concluded with the forum recommending all states to improve coordination by establishing inclusive, dedicated taskforces. 
Protecting women and girls against violence and other violations, not least by supporting initiatives to this end, is an integral part of the UN peacekeeping mission’s mandate in South Sudan.Distributed by APO Group on behalf of United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS).",https://www.zawya.com/en/press-release/africa-press-releases/south-sudan-eastern-equatoria-creates-taskforce-dedicated-to-addressing-gender-based-violence-i16idt49,zawya.com,"Tue, 29 Apr 2025 17:02:47 GMT"

“A poor workman quarrels with his tools,” goes an English saying. Being a politician in South Sudan has become too simple. 
You just join a party of your choice—make wrong decisions, cry a lot, and call America afterwards for interventions and assistance. It is called political immaturity—delinquency, in other words. They are too much into holding others accountable for their wrongdoings. Imagine blaming the outsiders for the country’s crisis without proper reasons just to evade punishment by law.
The portrayal of the country’s image is worthless. They have shamed us enough by changing the greatness of the nation from rich to a hunger-strike country. From a peaceful and everyone’s dream home to a chaotic nation. And at worst, their behavior shows this country can’t survive without foreign aid, especially from the U.S. We act as though we were created yesterday, while the Americans existed thousands of years ago.
Dear crying politicians, the days of dependency on foreign aid are over. In layman’s terms, South Sudan doesn’t need America, the UK, Norway, or any outside world. The US and other superpowers had vitally played their roles in the liberation struggle. Meanwhile, the national population, including the politicians, is divided into two categories: the category that thinks the nation survives on the West’s assistance and the category that blames the presence of the Western world in our affairs as the root cause of our crisis. I, however, prove the two categories wrong.
Admittedly, the West stood with us until the last day to see us independent. While, importantly, independence alone is more than anything else. We now speak in our voice as an independent state recognized worldwide—due to the unwavering support of the Westerners. Not only did the West stand with us to see our self-determination become a reality, but they also brought us quality education. They, too, have tried so much to bring a democratic system, and here is how things fall apart. However, all these contributions are enough for us to expect more again from them and shouldn’t go unnoticed or unappreciated.
We should, however, be responsible for all the predicaments—by swallowing the mischief and accepting the truth. We reasonably have to accept the responsibility of creating the tumult because the nation is founded on a wobbly surface of political propaganda. We all want to lead just to get rich. Whereas the national reform agenda has been left far enough. Emphatically, the country lacks faithful politicians whose ideologies incredibly bring citizens together.
One of the factors making Westerners a bad omen is because they have fallen on deaf ears and are gradually cutting ties with us. Again, we are interested in getting aid from them instead of learning problem-solving mechanisms. Besides, the West becomes a problem when the nationals grant them an intrusion. In other words, they double down on your weakness. Hence, he/she who blames or expects them to solve their problem is under the influence of one’s imagination.
Finally, the possible solutions to our problems are with us: acknowledgement of our maladroit handling of our affairs, acceptance of holding ourselves accountable for our wrongdoings minus expecting the Westerners’ involvement, and eradication of political misrepresentation. Misrepresentation of the national duty is when the country calls you for its duty; the call becomes as Godly as the call of Abraham , who left his own cradle land, his extended family, and, specifically, his parents. Only to fulfill God’s wish of finding unseen land. Similarly, anyone who is on a national call should forget about being a tribe man and become a national asset. For it is said in the Bible, “Fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.” Similarly, the adoption of patriotism, nationalism, democracy, and socialism is the beginning of nation-building.
Have a blessed day!

This situation persists because our government and opposition have not focused on the needs of the South Sudanese people.
If the leaders fail to learn from the incidents of 2013-2016, citizens will have no choice but to bear the brunt of this suffering. As lives are lost, one must question whether there is a genuine plan to implement peace. This indicates that the peace agreement is weakening.
The conflict that has caused displacement in Morobo and Panyume between the South Sudan People’s Defense Forces (SSPDF) and opposition groups is undermining the 2018 peace agreement. Both sides are accusing each other based on the country’s political landscape and tribal differences. Leaders appear to be mobilizing youth on either side to serve their own interests.
The worst crisis in Panyume Payam of Morobo County included horrific civilian killings and the destruction of properties, including schools. These conditions, if allowed to persist, will yield disastrous results. Innocent citizens are left with no choice but to reconsider their expectations for peace in South Sudan.
It is clear that those who sponsor these ongoing crises must be held accountable for the bloodshed in the country. Predicting this situation is difficult, especially when considering how to handle a young nation like South Sudan. No day goes by without reports of attacks from either side. The government and opposition must adhere to their agreements to resolve disputes in the country.
Internal displaced persons should not have to suffer in camps for the sake of politicians fighting for their interests. The principal parties to the 2018 peace agreement must commit to ensuring that this nation does not return to war. They should reflect on where their current power struggles will lead them and consider the consequences of killing innocent people for personal gain. For instance, many displaced persons who recently returned from Uganda have become internally displaced once again within their own country.
On April 21, 2022, the Ugandan government warned South Sudanese leaders about the refugees in Uganda, urging the South Sudanese government to mobilize resources for them. The pressing question is: when will South Sudan achieve peace and allow its people to return home from exile? While refugees suffer from hunger for months and face violence from local communities, they are forced to buy land to grow vegetables for sustenance.
I appeal to both the government and opposition leaders of South Sudan to seek out those who violate the peace and continue to incite tensions in the country, must be held accountable for the loss of lives. I also urge them to prevent any return to war in South Sudan.",https://onecitizendaily.com/index.php/2025/04/29/nation-talks-104/,onecitizendaily.com,"Tue, 29 Apr 2025 16:22:10 GMT"

By Jacob Onuha Nelson
At least two people were killed and dozens injured in Mura and Tirangore bomas of Kiyala Payam, Torit County of Eastern Equatoria State recycling intercommunal violence.
Tirangore Boma Paramount Chief, Mr. Peter Ikalu Aukario told No. 1 Citizen Newspaper, on phone that the incident occurred over a disputed piece of land.
Each of the communities claim ownership of the land.
“Since 1998, the two communities have been claiming the piece of land belongs to one another,” he stated.
“The two communities have also been attacking and looting people on the Torit – Kapoeta road, which endangers the lives of passengers,” Peter added.
For his part, Mr. Galileo Ohide Juliano, the Paramount Chief of Mura Boma, confirmed the incident and described it as “disastrous.”
“Within two to three days, we need the government to rescue the lives of people and resolve the situation before anything disastrous happens again,” Ohide stressed.
“We need peace, we don’t want violence. We urge the communities to live in peace, and whoever is held accountable should pay for their actions or be brought to justice,” Juliano stated.
According to residents in both villages, “the Commissioner once came to resolve the issue, but the youths from both communities refused to resolve the conflict. The Commissioner then ordered the communities to reveal the suspects before he would take further steps.”
The residents urge the state government of Eastern Equatoria State to intervene in the situation and hold the suspects accountable.",https://onecitizendaily.com/index.php/2025/04/29/two-killed-in-torit/,onecitizendaily.com,"Tue, 29 Apr 2025 16:15:13 GMT"

Jonglei State governor, Dr. Riak Gai Kok, started his tour of the counties of Jonglei State on Monday to sensitize communities about peaceful coexistence.
According to Minister for Information in Jonglei State, Nyamal Loi, the governor began on Sunday with Twic East and on Monday extended to Ayod Counties to share peace messages.
“This visit has just started yesterday, in Panyangor, the headquarters of Twic East County, and has travelled again today to Ayod. It’s a peace mission,” she said.
Speaking to No. 1 Citizen Daily Newspaper, Nyamal, the Minister for Information in Jonglei State, says the governor will spend three days engaging the communities in Ayod and Nyiror about peaceful coexistence.
“This mission is a mission of peace; the governor is going to brief the communities of Ayod and Nyirol about peace because there have been some disputes among the communities of Ayod and Nyirol,” she said.
According to the information minister, the governor would also encourage local communities across Jonglei State to embark on farming as the rainy season begins.
“Since it’s the rainy season, the governor would like to encourage the communities about farming. In fact, we do know that the organisations operating in Jonglei are facing a shrinking of funds, which has forced some organisations to close. It’s good to encourage the communities to cultivate.’’ She added.
He emphasised that the Jonglei State government is committed to engaging the Pibor administrative area to ensure sufficient security to ease agricultural activities this year among the locals.
The governor’s visit is being facilitated by the State Ministry of Peace Building in collaboration with the Peace Canal Organisation.

A young, ambitious South Sudanese writer and freelance journalist, Manas James Akony, launched his first book, titled “The Untold Stories of the Liberation Struggles,” on April 26th at the French Institute, University of Juba.
Notable attendees at the launch included Professor Peter Adwok Nyaba, David Okier Akay, and Aleu Ayieny Aleu, along with other prominent figures from the literary community.
Manas explained that the book originated from a suggestion by a close friend who recognized his potential and insight, suggesting he document the history of the heroic figures who led the liberation of South Sudan.
The book, “The Untold Stories,” depicts resilience and courage during the journey towards independence and pays tribute to the heroes who sacrificed their lives for freedom.
It digs deep into the history and culture of the Anyuak people and their contribution to the liberation of South Sudan.
The book features profiles of key figures whose contributions were vital to independence, showcasing the diverse talents and sacrifices that shaped the nation. It also examines the impact of war from the colonial to the post-colonial era.
Mr. Aleu Ayieny Aleu, one of the speakers at the event, appreciated Manas for the time and effort he invested in the book and for inviting distinguished guests, especially Professor Peter Adwok Nyaba, a senior book critic.
“I would like to thank Manas for bringing Professor Adwok here. Anyone who is launching a book and has not invited Adwok to the panel, your book has not been truly criticized,” Mr. Aleu remarked.
Additionally, Mr. Aleu was infuriated about the unnoticed recognition towards book launching in South Sudan urging that the spirit of education is fading among scholars. He adds students to be encouraged as many of them are afraid to come out and showcase their talents.
“I would want to even quarrel with the university otherwise promotion of books and launching of books is a very big academic issue and especially at the university. who would expect a book to be launched at a small house like this. And all the students are all here, they don’t care whether there is a book written or not. The spirit of education in this institution is not correct. Otherwise, anybody launching and especially young men like this, we should have all been there. When I came, I was thinking that I might miss getting a chair. I think students should be encouraged to be writers because among them there are so many writers but they are all afraid.”
In his speech, Professor Peter Adwok Nyaba applauded scholars and future writers for skillfully bringing their ideas to life through writing. He also emphasized the importance of the novel.
“I am encouraged that young people are taking up the pen in order to be able to put their ideas, the knowledge and whatever they have acquired through research on paper. They have generated the ideas, the have generated the knowledge and pit it on paper,” Peter stated.
The speeches were accompanied by ceremonial entertainment, including cultural dances, a question-and-answer (Q&A) session, and interaction with the audience.

Local authorities in Arinyapi Sub County, Adjumani District, in Uganda’s North West Nile Region, have reported the arrest and detention of two suspected cattle raiders believed to be from South Sudan.
The arrests relate to the theft of an unspecified number of cattle from residents of Arinyapi Sub County.
According to John Sabuni, the District Local Councilor (DLC) for Arinyapi Sub County, the incident occurred last week when an entire kraal (cattle enclosure) was raided, and the perpetrators made off with herds of cattle.
Sabuni stated that after the raid was reported, security personnel pursued the attackers, recovered the stolen cattle, and arrested two suspects. Other alleged raiders remain at large.
“No identification cards were found on them at the time of arrest, but based on their physical appearance, one could conclude that they are from Dinka communities in South Sudan,” said Sabuni.
Although Sabuni could not provide the exact number of cattle stolen, local media outlets reported that 200 cattle were recovered from the two arrested suspects.
The suspects were intercepted in the neighboring Amuru District, across the River Unyama, while attempting to cross back into South Sudan.
Arinyapi Sub County, located in Uganda’s Adjumani District, shares a border with South Sudan’s Eastern Equatoria State.
Sabuni noted that residents in the sub-county have lived in fear for a long time due to recurrent incursions by cattle raiders from South Sudan.
The area councilor attributed the persistent cattle theft in the sub-county to poorly controlled border crossings between South Sudan and Uganda.
“Although police and army are doing their best, the security situation is alarming because the border is open and criminals can easily enter Uganda and leave at will when police are not aware, the situation is wanting, and people are insecure because of rampant raids and cattle theft,” added Sabuni.",https://onecitizendaily.com/index.php/2025/04/29/two-south-sudanese-arrested-in-uganda/,onecitizendaily.com,"Tue, 29 Apr 2025 15:48:00 GMT"
Peace deal stalls amid political standoff- RJMEC,By Philip Buda Ladu A new report from the Reconstituted Joint Monitoring and Evaluation Commission (RJMEC) reveals that the implementation of South Sudan’s Revitalized Peace Agreement (R-ARCS…,"By Philip Buda Ladu
A new report from the Reconstituted Joint Monitoring and Evaluation Commission (RJMEC) reveals that the implementation of South Sudan’s Revitalized Peace Agreement (R-ARCSS) significantly stalled during the first quarter, this year.
The report, the 26th since signing of the 2018 agreement, attributes this halt to a deteriorating political and security environment, including an escalation of armed conflict and violence across the country.
RJMEC warns that this lack of progress and worsening situation is jeopardizing the fragile peace process established by the agreement.
It further noted the detention and imprisonment of several high-ranking opposition members and Parliamentarians, as well as the house arrest of First Vice President Dr. Riek Machar Teny.
These developments, coupled with reshuffles in ministerial positions at both national and state levels, and within the Presidency, signal a worrying trend away from the principles of collegiality, consultation, and consensus that underpin the peace agreement.
Amb. Owino’s report explicitly stated that the implementation of the Agreement “ground to a halt” during the reporting period, attributing this stagnation to repeated violations by the parties involved and a significant worsening of the political and security landscape in South Sudan.
The report points to security violations reportedly committed by both the South Sudan People’s Defence Forces (SSPDF) and the Sudan People’s Liberation Army – In Opposition (SPLA-IO), which are now threatening the country’s stability.
Furthermore, critical aspects of the agreement, such as the unification and deployment of forces, have seen no progress, with Phase I deployment remaining incomplete and Phase II training yet to commence.
The escalating violence has had a devastating impact on civilians, including women and children, who have reportedly suffered serious human rights and humanitarian law violations, including death, injury, and displacement due to military operations and related armed clashes.
R-JMEC interim chair noted that the escalating violence have exacerbated the already severe humanitarian crisis in South Sudan, compounded by inter-communal clashes, land disputes, insecurity, natural disasters, a cholera outbreak, and cross-border movements, leading to an increase in the number of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) requiring urgent assistance.
Despite the bleak assessment of the peace process, the report acknowledges some limited progress in areas such as Public Financial Management, particularly with the ongoing implementation of the Treasury Single Account (TSA).
Additionally, R-JMEC quarterly report noted that the National Constitutional Review Commission (NCRC) launched its civic education and public consultation process for the drafting of a permanent constitution. However, the report noted “very little progress” in the crucial areas of Transitional Justice, Accountability, Reconciliation, and Healing.
In response to the deteriorating situation, Amb. Owino said RJMEC engaged in extensive diplomatic efforts involving the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), the African Union, the United Nations, and key international partners.
These efforts included an Extraordinary Summit of IGAD Heads of State and Government, a meeting of the AU Peace and Security Council, and high-level visits and shuttle diplomacy. Despite these interventions, the political and security situation on the ground remains largely unchanged.
The RJMEC report concluded with a series of urgent recommendations directed at various stakeholders, including the Parties to the Agreement, the Revitalized Transitional Government of National Unity (RTGoNU), the Transitional National Legislature (TNL), IGAD, the African Union, and international partners.
Key recommendations include an immediate cessation of all forms of hostility, the release of detained SPLA-IO leaders and military officials, the reactivation of Agreement implementation institutions, the prioritization of force unification, and the expedition of crucial legislative and judicial reforms.
The report emphasized the critical juncture at which the South Sudan peace process finds itself.
While acknowledging that the R-ARCSS remains the most viable framework for lasting peace, the report warns that the current fragile and volatile situation poses a “serious threat to the survivability” of the Agreement.
This month, the head of the UN Mission in South Sudan, Mr. Nicholas Haysom said South Sudan stands at a perilous juncture, with escalating political tensions threatening to unravel a fragile peace deal and ignite renewed conflict in the already crisis-stricken nation.
He sounded warning to the Security Council in a grave briefing, highlighting a dangerous political standoff between President Salva Kiir and detained First Vice President Riek Machar, the two key principal signatories to the 2018 Revitalised Peace Agreement.
Mr. Haysom pointed to mounting volatility in Upper Nile state, fueled by reports of renewed mobilization by the White Army militia and the South Sudan People’s Defence Forces (SSPDF), as well as alleged child recruitment and the deployment of Ugandan forces at the government’s request.",https://onecitizendaily.com/index.php/2025/04/29/peace-deal-stalls-amid-political-standoff-rjmec/,onecitizendaily.com,"Tue, 29 Apr 2025 15:36:06 GMT"

The American magazine Responsible Statecraft published an analysis of the escalating violence in South Sudan between the South Sudan People's Defense Forces (SPDF) loyal to President Salva Kiir and the military wing loyal to his deputy, Riek Machar, also known as the White Army.
The armed clashes between the two factions came after President Salva Kiir placed his deputy, Machar, the leader of the country's main opposition, under house arrest in the capital, Juba, last March.

In response to the detention of its president and some of its senior leaders, the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM), led by Machar, announced the immediate suspension of its participation in the main security mechanisms established under the 2018 Revitalized Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan.

UN Warnings
In response, the government accused Machar of planning a rebellion to derail peace and the upcoming elections. The United Nations issued multiple warnings that South Sudan was on the brink of civil war and urged all parties to adhere to the peace agreement.
In an analytical article published by the American magazine, writer Asha Asokan attributed the increased tension in South Sudan to Kiir's appointment of businessman Benjamin Bol Mel as his successor. Bol Mel has been on the US sanctions list since 2017 for his involvement in government corruption.

She said that what exacerbated the security situation in the country was that Uganda sent soldiers to South Sudan to support Salva Kiir and his government, violating a UN arms embargo. An Extension of an Old Conflict
Asokan pointed out that the current situation in South Sudan resembles the conflict that erupted between the two sides from 2013 to 2018, which was characterized by mutual accusations of plotting a coup, violent clashes, the dissemination of misinformation, hate speech, the mobilization of their supporters for confrontation, and the involvement of foreign powers.
The conflict between Salva Kiir and Machar predates South Sudan's secession in 2011, according to Asokan, who noted that the president belongs to the Dinka tribe, while his rival hails from the Nuer tribe, the two main tribes in South Sudan.
Both were key figures in the Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Army (SPLM/A), founded and initially led by the late John Garang during its long war that culminated in secession from Sudan.

Internal and External Causes
According to Asokan, who holds a Master's degree in International Development Policy from Duke University, the political stalemate that fuels violence is a lack of effective governance, corruption, unaddressed grievances, and the ongoing competition for control of South Sudan's resources and military.
Regional repercussions have also contributed to the worsening situation in South Sudan. The author believes that the war raging in neighboring Sudan between the army led by Lieutenant General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces led by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (Hemedti) has had a significant impact on events in the southern neighbor.
She believes that the rapprochement between Salva Kiir and the Rapid Support Forces may have prompted the Sudanese army to revitalize its ties with Riek Machar.

Reports indicating that Machar's White Army has received weapons and other forms of support from the Sudanese Armed Forces reinforce these suspicions, according to Asokan.

Warning of the Conflict Spreading Abroad
Furthermore, the recent fighting between the White Army and the Rapid Support Forces in Upper Nile and Blue Nile states indicates that the Sudanese Armed Forces are moving to prevent the movements of Hemedti's forces and their ally, the Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North.
The author believes that the proxy war between South Sudan and Sudan, fueled by the support of both governments for opposing militias, threatens to further destabilize the two countries and the Horn of Africa, undermining already fragile peace processes and potentially threatening a full-scale conflict that could drag the two neighbors into direct war.
In addition, there is the potential for the conflict to increase refugee flows to other neighboring countries such as Uganda, Ethiopia, and Kenya, undermine cross-border security, and lead to economic disruption.",https://www.aljazeera.net/politics/2025/4/29/%d9%85%d8%ac%d9%84%d8%a9-%d8%a3%d9%85%d9%8a%d8%b1%d9%83%d9%8a%d8%a9-%d8%ac%d9%86%d9%88%d8%a8-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%b3%d9%88%d8%af%d8%a7%d9%86-%d8%b9%d9%84%d9%89-%d8%b4%d9%81%d8%a7-%d8%ad%d8%b1%d8%a8,aljazeera.net,"Tue, 29 Apr 2025 15:33:32 GMT"

Par stated that SPLM-IO members are working continuously to ensure that peace implementation proceeds and security stabilizes.
The SPLM-IO interim chairperson made these remarks while addressing attendees at the late Matai Gatlauk’s funeral in Juba, an event that brought together politicians, church leaders, and various community members.
“We can not allow this peace agreement to collapse, this peace agreement is a tall building and if it collapses, the damages will be on all of us”, Par said.
Par expressed that his team remains committed to ensuring Dr. Riek Machar is released from house arrest. He called on members to unite and work towards peace implementation and the unity of South Sudanese.
Earlier this month, Stephen Par Kuol and other members convened a consultative meeting that brought hundreds of SPLM-IO members together.
This event resulted in nominations for interim chair, deputy chair, and secretary general, with Par Kuol nominated for the top interim position.
However, Kuol’s nomination as Interim Chair, replacing Dr. Machar (who remains under house arrest), has faced significant rejection from many SPLM/A-IO members loyal to Machar. Par Kuol himself had reportedly been suspended by the faction loyal to Machar prior to this move.
Despite these rejections, Par and his team in Juba insist they remain committed to implementing the peace agreement, a situation that has created a political dilemma within the opposition party.
After assuming the role of Interim Chair, Stephen Par Kuol stated that the decision was not intended to permanently replace Dr. Machar, but rather to facilitate his release and the implementation of the peace agreement.
Meanwhile, Oyet Nathaniel, the Acting Chairman of the SPLM-IO faction loyal to Machar, denounced the replacement of Dr. Machar by Par Kuol.
Oyet stated that the meeting purporting to replace Dr. Machar was illegal and urged all members to distance themselves from Par Kuol’s leadership, suggesting they are being used to undermine the agreement.
“The gathering failing to meet the provision of the party constitution, it was not only illegal but null and void,” he said. “The replacement of Dr. Machar by suspended members of SPLM/A-IO is illegal and i urged our members to distance themselves from Par Kuol.”
“The gathering failed to meet the provisions of the party constitution; it was not only illegal but null and void,” Oyet said. “The replacement of Dr. Machar by suspended members of SPLM/A-IO is illegal, and I urge our members to distance themselves from Par Kuol.”
In response, SPLA-IO Acting Chief of General Staff Lt. Gen. Peter Thok Chuol and Director General for National Security Services Lt. Gen. Yiey Dak (who reportedly fled Juba fearing arrest) instructed all Sector and Division Commanders to distance themselves from the interim leadership based in Juba, terming them “betrayers in Juba.”
Separately, the SPLM-IO leadership in Northern Bahr el Ghazal expressed support for the party’s nominated interim Chairperson, Stephen Par Kuol.
The State SPLM-IO Chairman in Northern Bahr el Ghazal, Daniel Akot Akot, reaffirmed his allegiance to the Interim Leadership, stating that it would facilitate calls for the release of Dr. Riek Machar.",https://onecitizendaily.com/index.php/2025/04/29/commits-to-prevent-peace-collapse/,onecitizendaily.com,"Tue, 29 Apr 2025 15:14:10 GMT"

On April 24, Charles Data Bullen reported that over 7,000 Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) had sought refuge in the border town of Kaya, where they took shelter in schools and churches.
In the latest update, Commissioner Bullen disclosed that some of the IDPs—mainly women and children—have returned to Bulumbi, the area from which they were initially displaced. He expressed hope that most of the displaced will return to their homes soon.
“I was in Panyume, and people began returning. Within one week, I believe everyone will be back in their homes. We received about 230 people who were ready to return to their houses,” Data said.
“Panyume is a large area with several bomas, and yesterday we visited the center of Panyume as well as the border with Uganda, where we saw people coming back home.”
The commissioner said the influx has overwhelmed local resources, and appealed to the government and partners to intervene.
Mr. Bullen also added that the rainy season has worsened the situation, with many lacking food and shelter. The commissioner said learning had been disrupted in Morobo town as schools hosted displaced families.
The UN Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) urged an immediate end to hostilities and restoration of calm in Morobo and Yei counties, Central Equatoria State, following renewed clashes between government forces and the SPLA-IO in the region.
In a statement shared with Eye Radio, UNMISS Spokesperson Priyanka Chowdhury called on all military actors to refrain from conflict and prioritize the protection of civilians.
She warned that the escalating violence is deepening South Sudan’s already fragile political and security landscape, placing civilian lives in serious jeopardy.
“UNMISS is deeply concerned by reports of clashes between the South Sudan People’s Defense Forces and Sudan People’s Liberation Army-in Opposition in Morobo and Yei counties, which have led to civilian displacement and casualties,” Chowdhury said.
“The Mission calls for an immediate cessation of hostilities and restoration of calm, given already fragile political and security conditions in the country.”
The UN peacekeeping mission further appealed to the waring factions to refrain from conflict, prioritize the protection of civilians, resolve differences through dialogue, while ensuring unimpeded access for peacekeepers to reinforce security.
UNMISS added that it is engaging with authorities, security actors, faith-based groups, traditional leaders, youths, civil society and community leaders to prevent the situation from deteriorating.",https://www.eyeradio.org/230-idps-who-fled-latest-morobo-fighting-return-home-commissioner/,eyeradio.org,"Tue, 29 Apr 2025 14:22:10 GMT"
After Norway and Germany: The Netherlands joins the list of countries that have closed their embassies in South Sudan - Radio Tamazuj,"The Netherlands has announced its intention to close its embassy in Juba, the capital of South Sudan, as part of a process","The Netherlands has announced its intention to close its embassy in Juba, the capital of South Sudan, as part of a broader restructuring of its diplomatic missions due to budget constraints.

This move is part of plans to close five embassies and two consulates around the world, aiming to save €25 million (£21 million), as the Dutch government seeks to cut the foreign ministry's budget by 10%.

In a letter to parliament on April 17, Dutch Foreign Minister Kasper Veldkamp explained that the closures are necessary to adapt to ""far-reaching changes"" in global politics, including shifting power balances and rising operational costs.

In addition to Juba, the closures will include the Dutch embassies in Burundi, Libya, and Myanmar, as well as its consulates in Antwerp, Belgium, and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

The Dutch Foreign Ministry confirmed that the responsibilities of the affected countries will be transferred to other embassies to ensure the continuity of diplomatic and consular services.

This decision has raised concerns among analysts in South Sudan, who warned that it could signal a decline in international engagement with the country.

Dr. Abraham Kuol Newan, an expert in international politics at the University of Juba, told Radio Tamazuj that the closure should be seen as a “wake-up call” for the South Sudanese government.

He added, “This indicates that there is something wrong with diplomatic practice. If one country leaves, others may follow.”

He urged authorities to investigate the reasons for the move and strengthen relations with the remaining partners.

The Dutch government cited high security risks and high operational costs as the main factors in closing its missions in Juba and Tripoli, the capital of Libya.

South Sudan has faced instability since its independence in 2011, with a fragile peace agreement under increasing strain and a worsening humanitarian crisis.

If the embassy is closed, the Netherlands will become the third country to withdraw its embassy, ​​after Norway and Germany temporarily closed their embassies last March due to security concerns.

The United States also plans to reduce its diplomatic presence in South Sudan under proposed reductions by the Trump administration.

It's worth noting that the Netherlands recognized South Sudan's independence in 2011 and has supported peacebuilding and development efforts for decades.",https://www.radiotamazuj.org/ar/news/article/%d8%a8%d8%b9%d8%af-%d8%a7%d9%84%d9%86%d8%b1%d9%88%d9%8a%d8%ac-%d9%88%d8%a3%d9%84%d9%85%d8%a7%d9%86%d9%8a%d8%a7-%d9%87%d9%88%d9%84%d9%86%d8%af%d8%a7-%d8%aa%d9%86%d8%b6%d9%85-%d9%84%d9%82%d8%a7%d8%a6,radiotamazuj.org,"Tue, 29 Apr 2025 13:26:40 GMT"
"Nuer leaders accuse Lomuro of ""inciting genocide"" and demand his removal - Radio Tamazuj","Nuer community leaders in Juba, the capital of South Sudan, on Tuesday demanded the dismissal or resignation of the minister.","Representatives of the Nuer Leadership Forum for Peace speak to the media in Juba, Tuesday, April 29
South Sudan

Nuer community leaders in Juba, the capital of South Sudan, on Tuesday demanded the dismissal or resignation of Cabinet Affairs Minister Martin Elia Lomuro, accusing him of ""incitement"" amounting to ""genocide"" after he described some Nuer-majority areas as ""hostile"" to the government.

Lomuro's statements, classifying Nuer areas as hostile and friendly to the government, sparked widespread controversy across the country. He classified Nasir, Ulang, Akobo, Nyirol, Uror, Fangak, Ayod, Rubkona, and Panyijar as ""hostile,"" while Maiwut, Longshok, Guit, Leer, Mayendit, Koch, and Mayom as ""friendly.""

In a press release on Monday, the Nuer Peace Leadership Forum, led by Labor Minister General James Hoth Mai, rejected this interpretation, describing the minister's words as a ""dangerous escalation"" that could undermine peace efforts in the country.

Leaders of the Nuer Peace Forum accused Minister Lomuro of deliberately targeting Nuer-majority areas while ignoring violence in other areas, including his home state.

""Lomuro's statements are intended to incite the Nuer against the government and our Dinka brothers, and to erase our historical contributions to the liberation of South Sudan,"" they continued.

The forum warned that such rhetoric risks inflaming ethnic divisions and called on President Salva Kiir to dismiss Minister Elia Lomuro ""to give peace a chance.""

They also cited the UN Charter's protection against discrimination and urged unity amid ongoing instability across South Sudan, including cattle raids in Jonglei and clashes in Equatoria.

On Monday, the South Sudanese government said that Cabinet Affairs Minister Martin Elia Lomuro's remarks about categorizing some Nuer areas were false. The ""anti-government"" campaign does not target the Nuer tribe in general.

South Sudan is facing challenges in implementing the 2028 Revitalized Peace Agreement. The international and regional community warns of an escalation of conflict and a return to civil war due to the escalating conflict between President Salva Kiir and his first vice president, Riek Machar.

Last month, the South Sudan Media Authority warned politicians and the media against using rhetoric that incites hatred and hostility.

The 2018 Revitalized Peace Agreement stipulates the establishment of a hybrid court to bring perpetrators of war crimes to justice and a Truth, Reconciliation, Recovery, and Healing Commission. However, the establishment of both commissions has faced obstacles from the parties to the peace agreement.

The civil war since 2013 has left deep scars and increased suspicion and mistrust among South Sudan's tribal communities.

Africa: The Window to Salvage South Sudan's Peace Process Is Closing Fast,"Analysis - As a guarantor of the peace agreement, the African Union must urgently take action to de-escalate political tensions.","analysis
By Moses Chrispus Okello, Andrews Atta-Asamoah and Selam Tadesse Demissie


As a guarantor of the peace agreement, the African Union must urgently take action to de-escalate political tensions.
On 26 March, security personnel led by South Sudan's defence minister and national security chief entered First Vice-President Riek Machar's home, disarmed and removed his security detail, and placed him under house arrest.
The catalyst was his alleged role in recent skirmishes between the Dinka-dominated South Sudan People's Defence Forces (SSPDF) and the Nuer militia White Army. These erupted in early March, reportedly triggered by a disagreement over a long overdue rotation of the SSPDF's soldiers in Nasir garrison.





Information Minister Michael Makuei said the arrests were directed by President Salva Kiir to prevent attacks on government installations and safeguard the 2018 Revitalised Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan (R-ARCSS).
The government also arrested several influential opposition ministers and high-ranking military officers from the Sudan People's Liberation Movement-in-Opposition. Airstrikes were authorised in Nasir County and around Juba, and some opposition members have gone into hiding.
National tensions have been rising, with unilateral reshuffles in the transitional government of national unity, including at vice-president level. The reshuffles are allegedly linked to Kiir's attempt to orchestrate his succession outside the R-ARCSS. This reveals deep mistrust between the country's two leaders and contravenes the 2018 peace agreement.





Given the African Union's (AU) prior investment in stabilising South Sudan, swift action is imperative to prevent a complete collapse. This requires a clear understanding of the causes and implications of the evolving crisis, and the immediate options available to the Peace and Security Council (PSC).
The violence in Nasir and other areas is a continuation of intermittent violence, institutional fragility, intense political divisions and exclusionary politics that have characterised South Sudan since independence in 2011.
Due to longstanding mistrust between Kiir and Machar, neither has unified their armed groups into one national force. This mistrust has fuelled secondary fears tied to the uncertainty of elections and attempts to neutralise holdout groups and influential government figures through mediation and reshuffling.
While both leaders are central to national disagreements, conflicts affecting several payams, counties and states overlay national politics, creating a complex interplay between state and national dynamics. In Nasir, national disputes shaped county decisions and snowballed into a pretext to reconfigure transitional government relationships.





Similarly, the struggle to maintain the country's patronage infrastructure in the army and body politic remains deep-seated. Some interpret Kiir's repeated cabinet reshuffles as counterproductive efforts to assert control over the transitional government amid waning financial leverage and a failing economy.
The economic downturn is associated with the sharp decline in oil revenues caused by years of financial mismanagement and Sudan's civil war. Oil accounts for 90% of South Sudan's revenue and disruptions reduced daily production by about 68% between December 2024 and January 2025. This has undermined political leaders' efforts to sustain patronage and command the loyalty of their armed factions.
The integrity and sustainability of the R-ARCSS power-sharing arrangement depend on dialogue among the parties. However, Kiir's unilateral decision making creates the perception that he is consolidating power or preparing for a transition that excludes the opposition and others. The divisions that follow each dismissal have intensified tensions, leading to repeated extensions of the transitional timeframe.
The recent Nasir violence highlights the failure to even minimally implement the R-ARCSS and its milestones, and has reinforced the ongoing economic distress and mistrust amid ethnic tensions. This has brought the country to a crossroads with various possible outcomes, two of which stand out.


First, and most likely, the SSPDF, its associated militia, and armed groups such as the White Army, become entrenched in their positions, attracting additional actors on all sides. Since the Nasir outbreak, all factions have sought revenge for their losses, reinforcing their positions or protecting themselves from perceived threats.
This outcome is supported by the ongoing aerial and ground campaigns against the opposition in parts of the country, particularly outside Juba and in Upper Nile. This is evident in government officials' increasingly aggressive rhetoric, the postponement of an Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) ministers' visit, and the engagement of ethnic groups such as the Shilluk and Equatorias.
This outcome could see the collapse of the already precarious peace process. Even the Tumaini high-level process, which was intended to advance the R-ARCSS, is now in limbo.
The less likely second scenario is that Machar and some of his lieutenants receive a conditional release, which could lead to an improved but still tense situation. Taban Deng Gai, the Vice-President responsible for infrastructure, has advised Machar - while he awaits investigation and trial - to renounce the White Army and allow the government to integrate opposition forces into the SSPDF.
However, this would essentially amount to Machar's surrender - and is improbable, as renouncing the White Army would alienate the opposition leader from the Nuer community.
Such events would undermine Machar and create opportunities for Kiir's chosen transition actors to dominate the political scene. The degree to which Kiir continues to limit Machar's power will depend largely on Machar's influence in preventing the ascent of Kiir's preferred successors.
At the crossroads of these two scenarios is a slim window to salvage the peace process. However, it will become increasingly difficult to address the complex dynamics, including South Sudan's military agreement with Uganda, which may extend beyond the AU Panel of the Wise's scope.



In light of possible escalation, the AU - as an R-ARCSS guarantor - must act fast to support ongoing regional de-escalation measures. In addition to PSC meetings and calling for the AU High-Level Ad Hoc Committee of Five on South Sudan to support IGAD efforts, the AU could create a contact group with IGAD to focus on day-to-day de-escalation measures. A start would be establishing what happened in Nasir and who is responsible.
The PSC should try to secure the release not just of Machar but all opposition officials arbitrarily detained. The officials should also be reinstated in the structures outlined by the R-ARCSS.
These actions are vital to maintain the integrity of the power-sharing agreement. Delayed regional and continental engagement could see violence worsen and the window to salvage the peace process closing further.

South Sudan: Aid Cuts Push South Sudan Into Uncharted Territory,"Humanitarian assistance has been a lifeline, and an alternative to state authority.","Juba — Humanitarian assistance has been a lifeline, and an alternative to state authority.
Though the full impacts of the USAID funding cuts in South Sudan are still emerging, early signs point to their potential magnitude.
In April, eight people died of cholera trying to find medical treatment after US-funded clinics in Jonglei State were shuttered. Healthcare services at transit centres receiving people fleeing the war in Sudan have stopped. And the UN warns that hunger is nearing record levels - an alarming benchmark in a country that is no stranger to famine.
Yet reactions to the US funding cuts have been mixed among South Sudanese - a sign of the complex and often conflicted relationship between the country and an aid sector that has grown enmeshed with basic public services and the economy.


On social media, many early comments regarded the cuts as a positive step for the country. Arguments in support came from different angles, including that foreign aid has stunted economic development, made people lazy, or been embezzled before reaching those in need.
In person, however, those who lauded the demise of USAID online shared more nuanced views. Many expressed a sense of weary vindication at the crumbling of a US-dominated system they felt has long failed to move their country forward - even as they acknowledged the hardship its absence would bring.
For others, including residents of the country's many displacement sites or of refugee camps in neighbouring countries, the decision evoked feelings of anxiety and helplessness.


""You will not see someone in this camp applauding [US President Donald] Trump's decision"" said William Jal, a community leader in the Bentiu camp, home to more than 100,000 people displaced by war and flooding in Unity State. ""We have been chased from our homes and have nowhere to go. If the NGOs close tomorrow, it will be very hard for us.""
South Sudan - the world's youngest, and by some metrics poorest, country - is also one of the largest per-capita recipients of foreign aid globally. In 2024, more than one in three people received some form of emergency food assistance. Foreign donors fund 80% of the healthcare system.
Aid plays a critical role in the economy, too. An estimated 25% of South Sudan's Gross National Income stems from foreign aid, and aid jobs buoy much of the country's narrow middle class.
The cuts come as experts warn that South Sudan is edging closer to the brink of all-out war. In recent months, the government, backed by Ugandan forces, has launched a sweeping assault on opposition groups, bringing the 2018 peace agreement that ended the country's brutal civil war to a breaking point. International observers warn of a looming explosion of ethnic violence.


At stake is more than just the loss of services. The cuts mark a potential turning point for South Sudan, where aid has long functioned not only as a lifeline but as an alternative to state authority. Now, with hundreds of programmes shutting down - some of them decades old - communities are forced to reckon with the unravelling of a humanitarian system that has, for better or worse, been woven into the national fabric.
For many, its decline represents uncharted territory - offering almost certain hardship but also hope of breaking through a widely detested status quo. For others, it is an existential threat.
Support for cuts points to frustration with the government
The most common reason cited for supporting funding cuts is the belief that foreign aid has enabled bad governance by filling roles that the state has failed to deliver.
One university student from Bor, a town roughly 150 kilometres north of Juba, framed support for the cuts as frustration with the government itself. ""People are having positive responses [to the aid cuts] because they are tired of the government, which is not providing anything to its citizens. So now that the US has decided to cut aid, there will be pressure on the government,"" he said.
One Juba resident, who requested anonymity to speak freely about a sensitive topic, agreed. ""By removing aid from the equation, you are forcing the government to invest in their own people. Aid, and aid jobs, keep people complacent. Now, unemployment will put more pressure on the system.""
Recently, public patience for the growing pains of South Sudan's nascent state has worn thin.
Last year, national elections scheduled for December 2024 were cancelled, extending the transitional period for a fourth time. The economy, too, is in crisis: In parts of the country, food prices have surged 800% since 2023. Many speak of the urgent need for a change in leadership.
Still, the aid sector receives its share of blame.
Several people felt that the humanitarian system benefits its employees - who earn salaries hundreds of times higher than the national average - more than those in need. Others questioned the value of sprawling humanitarian missions as living conditions and security continue to deteriorate.
A common framing casts the aid sector and government as mutually reinforcing. ""There's a perception that the aid sector and the government collaborate to keep things the way they have been,"" said the Juba resident. ""Now, some people think the whole system needs to be burned down to get back on track.""


Benefiting from aid, but wanting change
Most, however, do not view the decline of foreign aid in black-and-white terms.
Opiyo Anthony returned to his hometown in Magwi, Eastern Equatoria State, in 2021 after five years living abroad in the Palabek refugee camp in northern Uganda. Conditions in the camp were difficult, he said, despite humanitarian support.
""We would always struggle because the food was not enough. I had eight people living with me, and sometimes the food [provided by NGOs] would run out with weeks left until the next distribution,"" he recalled. ""We kept struggling like that until I decided to return home and see if there was a better option for me and my family."" Now, he runs a farming cooperative of more than 100 people - most former refugees like himself.
Anthony, 53, called the decision to slash aid ""drastic"" and predicted that people will go hungry, get sick, and die as a result.
He also thinks the funding cuts will push people to return home from the refugee camps, where they can rebuild their lives. ""The provision of aid has kept people in the camp for too long,"" he said.
Such views reflect the cognitive dissonance experienced by those who have benefited from aid but feel that change is sorely needed.
One local aid worker in Juba feared losing his job due to funding cuts but hoped that the cost of living might fall as the UN and NGOs - whose outsized purchasing power he said has inflated prices - scale back their presence.
Sunny Ouda, a clinical assistant from Torit, has three sisters who live in the Kakuma refugee camp in northern Kenya. ""It's complicated,"" he said when asked how he felt about Trump's decision to downsize USAID.
""We have lots of resources here in South Sudan, but they are poorly managed,"" he said. ""What the NGOs are providing, our government can also provide. But only NGOs are paying good money. Without them, how can we support our families? So yes, we support Trump's decision, but we are crying at the same time.""
No roads, no hospitals
For many - perhaps most - South Sudanese, dire living conditions and the country's backslide towards war leave little room for optimism.
Nyakhim Doboul has lived in the Bentiu IDP camp since 2022, when she and her family fled a third consecutive year of historic flooding in Unity State. They joined more than 100,000 people, many who had been displaced by the war years earlier. She spoke highly of the services provided by the UN and NGOs in the camp, including healthcare and the reunification of separated children with their families.
Yet conditions in the camp are among the worst in the country. The flooding has submerged thousands of kilometres of farmland and pasture, decimating livelihoods. Many residents now subsist on waterlilies, which they collect from floodwaters polluted by nearby oil fields.
Conditions are now worsening as many services have been stopped or scaled back, and residents employed by aid organisations have lost their only source of income. Young girls are increasingly being married off in return for desperately needed dowry payments, said Doboul, and a cholera outbreak has killed nearly 200 people since December.


When asked about the support for aid cuts on social media, Doboul scoffed. ""We know some people have celebrated what Trump has done, but the people here cannot celebrate,"" she said. ""People say that USAID is promoting laziness. But that is not true. It is not USAID that put us here, it is the government.""
""What choice do we have?"" said William Jal, the camp leader. ""If there was no flooding, people here could cultivate to survive. If there was security, people could go home. But there are no roads and no hospitals, and the parties have failed to implement the peace agreement.""
Nyuon Kuey, a 29-year-old living in a refugee camp in the Gambella region of Ethiopia, agreed that any further decline in aid would place communities displaced by conflict in an untenable situation. ""If the refugees go home, they will be killed. That is why they are in refugee camps. South Sudan is still at war,"" he said.
Two days after speaking to The New Humanitarian by phone, the government carried out an aerial bombardment in Kuey's hometown of Nasir, where a local militia had recently clashed with government forces. Pictures of women and children burned alive in the attack circulated online. A fresh wave of refugees fled into Gambella, where US funding cuts now threaten to halt food aid.
""These people on social media who support Trump's decision are mostly in the capital or outside the country - they are not representative of the population,"" said Leben Moro, a professor at University of Juba and board member of the Rift Valley Institute think tank.
""People feel they do not benefit from foreign aid because they think internationals eat up the money and because it supports the government,"" said Moro. ""But these cuts will affect them eventually. People will feel differently when it begins to hit them.""

Netherlands Embassy in South Sudan to close down – Sudans Post,The government of the Netherlands has announced the closure of its embassy in Juba as part of a broader cost-cutting measure affecting its global diplomatic network.,"The decision, outlined by Dutch Minister of Foreign Affairs Caspar Veldkamp, is part of a 10% budget reduction for embassies, consulates, and permanent representations abroad, totalling approximately EUR 70 million.

JUBA – The government of the Netherlands has announced the closure of its embassy in Juba as part of a broader cost-cutting measure affecting its global diplomatic network.
The decision, outlined by Dutch Minister of Foreign Affairs Caspar Veldkamp, is part of a 10% budget reduction for embassies, consulates, and permanent representations abroad, totalling approximately EUR 70 million.
The Juba embassy is one of five set to close, alongside those in Bujumbura (Burundi), Havana (Cuba), Tripoli (Libya), and Yangon (Myanmar).
For South Sudan, the closure marks a significant shift in diplomatic relations with the Netherlands, a country that has been a key partner since South Sudan’s independence in 2011.
The Dutch embassy in Juba has supported development programs, peacebuilding initiatives, and humanitarian efforts, particularly in areas such as agriculture, water management, and gender equality.
The decision comes at a time when South Sudan continues to grapple with economic challenges, ongoing conflict, and humanitarian crises, raising concerns about the potential impact on bilateral cooperation.
Minister Veldkamp stated that the closures are necessary to achieve structural savings of EUR 25 million, with an additional four missions slated for closure in the near future.
The Dutch government said the decision was made in light of the current geopolitical situation, with the ministry prioritising economic and strategic considerations.
While the Netherlands may open new representations in other regions, such as Syria, depending on global developments, no immediate plans were announced to maintain a diplomatic presence in South Sudan.
The Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs plans to provide further details on the closures and potential expansions in its 2026 draft budget. For now, the closure of the Juba embassy underscores the broader challenges facing South Sudan as it navigates a complex global diplomatic landscape.
In March, the German Embassy in Juba temporarily closed amid growing political tensions in the country. No plans to resume operations were immediately made public.
This was followed by the United States announcing plans to close its embassy in Juba as part of a broader proposal by the Trump administration to shut down 10 embassies and 17 consulates worldwide.

Women in Medicine: Mobilizing the Health Sector to Launch a National Vaccination Campaign with Two Vital Vaccines - Radio Tamazuj,Health care cadres across South Sudan held a meeting on Monday in preparation for launching a vaccination campaign.,"Healthcare workers across South Sudan held a meeting on Monday in preparation for the launch of a large-scale vaccination campaign targeting the delivery of life-saving pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) and rotavirus vaccine, scheduled to begin on May 24.

The South Sudanese Women in Medicine (SSWM) initiative organized the seminar under the theme ""Mobilizing South Sudanese Health Workforce for PCV and Rotavirus Vaccination: A Shared Humanitarian Responsibility,"" as part of World Immunization Week.

The seminar saw widespread participation from doctors, nurses, pharmacists, dentists, and public health experts, as well as key partners from UNICEF and the World Health Organization (WHO), with the aim of strengthening coordination and mobilizing support for the official launch of the vaccination campaign in late May.

In her remarks at the event, Dr. Kwete Emily, co-founder and executive director of SSWM, emphasized the historic significance of this day in the journey to promoting public health in South Sudan.

She said, ""The seminar aimed to raise awareness among health workers about the importance of vaccines and their vital role in protecting community health, enhance cooperation and integration between various medical specialties, and restore and strengthen public confidence in immunization programs in light of the changes in the rollout schedule.""

For his part, Dr. Atem Nathan, Director General of Primary Healthcare Services at the Ministry of Health, emphasized the utmost importance of these national efforts, explaining, ""This day represents a pivotal milestone in our journey towards strengthening healthcare. Malaria, pneumonia, and diarrhea remain a major threat to the health of South Sudanese citizens and are among the leading causes of death.""

He added, ""Last year, we faced challenges in delivering the malaria vaccine due to low uptake. We cannot allow these mistakes to be repeated with the rollout of the pneumococcal and rotavirus vaccines, given their importance in protecting children.""

He pointed to the promising results of the pilot programs implemented in Upper Nile State, which demonstrated the remarkable effectiveness of vaccines, particularly in reducing pneumonia rates. He emphasized, ""This is our opportunity to scale up proven interventions, despite the significant logistical challenges we face, including the vast geographic area, poor infrastructure, and cold chain constraints. We must work hard to overcome these obstacles.""

Mukwaya Douglas, Cold Chain Officer for UNICEF South Sudan, highlighted the pivotal role of frontline healthcare workers, emphasizing the strategic partnership between UNICEF, the World Health Organization, and the government in the success of this campaign.

He continued, ""At the national level, our readiness has reached 78% according to the assessment tool, and we are working tirelessly to ensure state and county readiness. We have already received 2.7 million doses of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and 300,000 doses of rotavirus vaccine, with more shipments coming.""

He added, ""The training of health workers has been completed at the national level, and successive training courses will begin at the state and county levels once the ongoing measles campaign is completed.""

In a related context, Dr. Kwete shared the broader mission of her organization, a membership-based non-profit organization of female doctors, pharmacists, and dentists from South Sudan, to address gender disparities in leadership positions in the healthcare sector.

She declared, ""We rarely hear about female healthcare professionals leading initiatives of this magnitude and importance. We are here to change this stereotype. We believe that women have an influential voice, not only in providing patient care, but also in health policy-making.""",https://www.radiotamazuj.org/ar/news/article/%d9%86%d8%b3%d8%a7%d8%a1-%d9%81%d9%8a-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%b7%d8%a8-%d8%aa%d8%ad%d8%b4%d8%af-%d8%ac%d9%87%d9%88%d8%af-%d8%a7%d9%84%d9%82%d8%b7%d8%a7%d8%b9-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%b5%d8%ad%d9%8a-%d9%84%d8%a5%d8%b7,radiotamazuj.org,"Tue, 29 Apr 2025 11:16:59 GMT"

EASTERN EQUATORIA – While gender-based violence, including aggressions of a sexual nature, impacts women and girls across the globe, those living in societies that are more male-dominated than others run a significantly higher risk of being subjected to such violations. 
In South Sudan and other countries experiencing a conflict or post-conflict context, they are particularly vulnerable. Recognizing the devastating effects of this plague, Eastern Equatoria State has taken decisive action by establishing a taskforce dedicated to addressing and coordinating efforts to combat both gender-based violence and conflict-related sexual violence.
“We all have a moral obligation to stop all forms of violence against women and girls,” asserts Mikelina Emilio, a Gender Affairs Officer serving with the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS), whose support has been instrumental to the creation of the new and inclusive body.
Comprising 50 members, the taskforce includes representatives from government institutions, UN agencies, women-led networks, faith-based groups, youth unions, civil society and international organizations. It is committed to using their collective and complementary experiences and skills strength to develop strategies to tackle harmful cultural practices contributing to putting women and girls at risk of sexual and other forms of violence.
A propensity to deny girls the right to education, not least by condoning their early and often forced marriages and thus keeping them at home, is one such negative, gender-biased practice. So called blood compensation, where the family of an informally convicted murderer offers a girl or woman as a kind of “payment” to the relatives of the victim, is another. 
Both phenomena reflect and reinforce a view of women and girls as objects, assets and property rather than individuals with the same rights and entitlements as men and boys.
“It is our collective role and responsibility as stakeholders to work together to put an end to all forms of gender-based violence, and that is why we are here,” said Jennifer Nabongorika, the state’s Minister of Gender, Child and Social Welfare, who added that making efforts to hold perpetrators of violations accountable and providing adequate support to survivors will be important aspects of the work of the taskforce.
The origin of the Eastern Equatorian initiative can be traced back to 2023, when the peacekeeping mission and the national Ministry of Gender, Child and Social Welfare hosted a forum to discuss methods to address sexual and other forms of gender-based violence. 
A thorough analysis of trends and challenges related to the issue concluded with the forum recommending all states to improve coordination by establishing inclusive, dedicated taskforces. 
Protecting women and girls against violence and other violations, not least by supporting initiatives to this end, is an integral part of the UN peacekeeping mission’s mandate in South Sudan.",https://unmiss.unmissions.org/eastern-equatoria-creates-taskforce-dedicated-addressing-gender-based-violence,unmissions.org,"Tue, 29 Apr 2025 11:04:01 GMT"
"After being described as ""hostile"": The government changes its tone towards the Nuer areas - Radio Tamazuj","The government of South Sudan said on Monday that the statements of the Minister of Cabinet Affairs, Martin Elia Lomuro, regarding the categorization of","The South Sudanese government said on Monday that Cabinet Affairs Minister Martin Elia Lomuro's statements, categorizing some Nuer areas as ""hostile"" to the government, did not target the Nuer tribe in general.

Last Saturday, Lomuro's statements sparked widespread controversy when he classified some Nuer areas as ""hostile"" and others as ""friendly"" to the government. Critics accused the government of fueling ethnic divisions, and analysts also warned that the inflammatory rhetoric threatens to further destabilize the country.

Lomuro's statements came as political tensions escalated between Salva Kiir and Riek Machar, after Machar was placed under house arrest in Juba on Kiir's orders, on charges that his movement was linked to the armed Nuer youth group ""the White Army"" in Nasir County, Upper Nile State.

Joseph Jeng Akec, Minister of Youth and Sports, told reporters in Juba on Monday that the term ""hostile"" refers only to organized armed groups, not the Nuer tribe as a whole.

He continued, ""The government's reference to hostile groups refers to specific organized groups, not an entire ethnic group, and such cases will be addressed through reconciliation efforts under the 2018 peace agreement.""",https://www.radiotamazuj.org/ar/news/article/%d8%a8%d8%b9%d8%af-%d9%88%d8%b5%d9%81%d9%87%d8%a7-%d8%a8%d9%80%d8%a7%d9%84%d9%85%d8%b9%d8%a7%d8%af%d9%8a%d8%a9-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%ad%d9%83%d9%88%d9%85%d8%a9-%d8%aa%d8%ba%d9%8a%d8%b1-%d9%86%d8%a8,radiotamazuj.org,"Tue, 29 Apr 2025 10:54:18 GMT"

Peace Monitoring Commission: Continued Violations Undermine South Sudan Peace Agreement - Radio Tamazuj,The Joint Monitoring and Evaluation Commission for the South Sudan Peace Agreement said on Monday that the security situation,"The Joint Monitoring and Evaluation Commission (JMEC) for the South Sudan Peace Agreement (SSP) said on Monday that the security and political situation in the country has deteriorated due to repeated violations, which have hindered the implementation of the 2028 Revitalized Peace Agreement.

The commission said in a report that the first quarterly report, covering the period from January to March 2025, prepared under Article 7.9 of the Revitalized Agreement, documented repeated violations.

The report noted that ""during the first quarter of the year, implementation of the agreement stalled, as parties committed repeated violations of the agreement, and the political and security environment clearly deteriorated.""

It added, ""In scenes not witnessed since the signing of the agreement more than six years ago, armed conflict and violence erupted across the country, a number of opposition members were arrested and imprisoned, and First Vice President Dr. Riek Machar Teny was placed under house arrest.""

He continued, ""Ministerial positions have been redistributed at the state and national levels, as well as within the presidency, and some ministerial portfolios within the institutions and mechanisms of the agreement have been relinquished.""

According to the Commission, civilians, including women and children, have borne the brunt of the repercussions in some parts of the country, suffering grave violations of human rights and humanitarian law, including deaths, injuries, and displacement due to military operations and associated armed clashes.

The Commission emphasized that the Revitalized Peace Agreement remains the most viable framework for guiding South Sudan toward a path of stability and prosperity, adding that the current political and security situation is extremely fragile and volatile, posing a serious threat to the sustainability of the agreement.

The Commission stated that the country has witnessed weeks of armed clashes between government forces and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement-in-Opposition (SPLM-IO), the two parties to the agreement, in several areas, including attacks on cantonment sites and training centers in Luri, Rajaf, Panyomi, and other areas.

The Commission noted that the implementation of the peace agreement is threatened by the arrest and detention of some senior political and military leaders of the SPLM-IO, who are an integral part of the agreement and play a crucial role in its full implementation, according to the statement.

The report added that ""another factor is the dismissal and replacement of some opposition leaders from various ministerial portfolios at the national and state levels without consultation, agreement, or compromise with the relevant parties, as stipulated in the Comprehensive Peace Agreement.""

The Commission said that other threats to the agreement include the relinquishment of ministerial portfolios and some institutions and mechanisms of the agreement by SPLM-IO leaders and officials for fear of being targeted for arrest or detention. The Commission stated that one of the threats to the agreement is the inability of the parties' leadership to engage in dialogue and resolve emerging security and political challenges within the framework of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement.

The Commission emphasized that the escalation of political and security tensions in South Sudan does not bode well for the sustainability of lasting peace and stressed the need for the parties to the agreement to make every effort to strictly adhere to the Revitalized Peace Agreement.

The report noted that ""despite the significant decline in trust between the parties, there is still room for re-engagement and dialogue.""

The report also recommended ""intensifying efforts to complete the unification of forces, unconditionally release detainees, and advance the constitutional drafting process.""",https://www.radiotamazuj.org/ar/news/article/%d9%85%d9%81%d9%88%d8%b6%d9%8a%d8%a9-%d9%85%d8%b1%d8%a7%d9%82%d8%a8%d8%a9-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%b3%d9%84%d8%a7%d9%85-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%a7%d9%86%d8%aa%d9%87%d8%a7%d9%83%d8%a7%d8%aa-%d8%a7%d9%84%d9%85%d8%b3,radiotamazuj.org,"Tue, 29 Apr 2025 10:14:49 GMT"

The event drew scholars, political figures and members of the public, serving as both a literary milestone and a moment of national reflection.


Okony thanked attendees for their support.


“The success of this launch was made possible by each one of you,” he said. “While I may not have named everyone, you all hold a special place in my heart.”


He said the idea for the book emerged from a 2021 conversation during a community event. The need to honor those who fought for South Sudan’s freedom, he said, motivated him to write it.


“Our history is filled with sacrifice, and I felt a responsibility to preserve these stories,” he added.


Notable attendees included academics Prf. Peter Adwok Nyaba, Dr. Abraham Kuol Nyuon and Garang Yach James, as well as Lt. Gen. David Okwir and Lt. Gen. Aleu Ayieny Aleu.


Nyaba praised the book’s condensed yet rich historical account.


“This small book contains knowledge that could fill volumes,” he said. “It documents the Anyuak people’s role in the struggle.”


Aleu called the book a vital reminder of the nation’s past.


“Manas has ensured we don’t forget the sacrifices that built this country,” he said, urging young people to document their own histories.


Nyuon, principal of Juba University’s Graduate College, said the book would spark national dialogue, particularly on historical disputes like the Ilemi Triangle.


Okony, a member of the Anyuak ethnic group, holds a public health degree from Upper Nile University.


Garang Yach James noted the book highlights often-overlooked contributions by minority groups.


“This is likely the first book to recognize the Anyuak’s role in supporting liberation movements,” he said.

Speaking after the country’s first-ever National Trade Forum on Monday in Juba, the Vice President made the controversial proposal at a national trade forum, citing massive losses from electricity theft and systemic corruption.
He expressed deep frustration over unchecked corruption and power theft, specifically within the Juba Electricity Distribution Company (JEDCO).
Deng revealed that the company is losing an estimated $8 million annually due to electricity theft, facilitated in part by insiders within the system.
Despite filing over 350 cases of electricity theft with the police, only two have reportedly made it to court—something he attributed to entrenched corruption within law enforcement and the judiciary.
“There are only two cases out of 350 that have been prosecuted. This is due to corruption, which prevents these cases from progressing,” he said. “Four individuals are responsible for orchestrating these thefts, and they are even threatening people.”
Deng warned that if these issues are not urgently addressed, JEDCO could face collapse.
“The company said if the problem is not resolved, it will collapse and shut down,” he noted. “We must act. There are serious discussions on how to stop corruption. We should consider a firing squad.”
The Vice President’s controversial remarks came in response to reports that some engineers are helping residents bypass power meters, effectively stealing electricity. He described this as a deliberate criminal act that is undermining the country’s fragile economy.
South Sudan has long grappled with systemic corruption. According to Transparency International’s 2023 Corruption Perceptions Index, the country scored just 8 out of 100, ranking 180th out of 180 countries—making it the most corrupt nation in the world, according to the index.

The Dutch embassy, opened shortly after South Sudan gained independence in 2011, has been a key player in supporting development, peacebuilding, and governance in the country.
South Sudan is one of seven confirmed locations where Dutch diplomatic missions will close. Others include embassies in Cuba, Libya, and Myanmar, and consulates-general in Antwerp (Belgium) and Rio de Janeiro (Brazil).
The closures were confirmed in a letter from Dutch Foreign Minister Caspar Veldkamp to parliament on April 17. The move is part of a 10% budget cut across the Dutch diplomatic service—about €70 million in total savings.
The government described the decision as a response to an increasingly unstable global environment, saying it wants a more “realistic foreign policy” focused on national security, trade, and migration. While acknowledging the closures are difficult, the Foreign Ministry called them “necessary.”
The Netherlands has been one of South Sudan’s major development partners, supporting projects in education, water and food security, reproductive health, and governance.

The medical team, supported by volunteers and local organizations, has performed eye surgeries on refugees and asylum seekers, mostly from South Sudan and Somalia.

The Calp-based NGO Visió Sense Fronteres has performed a total of 148 eye surgeries in its latest campaign in the Kakuma refugee camp (Kenya), one of the largest concentrations of displaced population in Africa, hosting nearly 300,000 refugees and asylum seekers.
Most of the operations were for cataracts, although patients with pterygium and trachoma sequelae were also treated. One of the most notable operations was performed under general anesthesia on a three-year-old boy with bilateral congenital cataracts, who was able to see for the first time thanks to this operation.

Three ophthalmologists, two nurses, an anesthesiologist, three optometrists, and a volunteer traveled to this refugee camp. They received assistance from the humanitarian organization Embracing the World in Kenya, as well as two local nurses who, in the weeks leading up to the campaign, conducted intensive screening, allowing nearly 900 people to be seen.

""The days have been intense and marathon, from dawn to dusk, but the dedication of the team—made up of ophthalmologists, optometrists, nurses, and local staff—has made it possible to complete all the planned surgeries, deliver 220 sunglasses for postoperative protection, and fit patients with prescription glasses to improve their quality of life,"" said Isabel Signes, coordinator of Visió Sense Fronteres, who thanked the UNHCR, the Turkana County Government, and the Calpe City Council for their collaboration. “Thanks to this, we have been able to restore sight—and with it, dignity and hope—to people who had been living in darkness for years, affected by advanced cataracts or other untreated eye conditions,” he said.
The Kakuma refugee camp, located in northwestern Kenya, houses refugees and asylum seekers, mostly from South Sudan and Somalia, but also from other African countries such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burundi, Sudan, and Ethiopia, who have mostly fled war, violence, and persecution in East Africa and the Horn of Africa.
“The campaign in Kakuma has been a true milestone, not only in terms of clinical outcomes, but also in terms of human impact: it has literally brought light back to those who need it most,” Signes said.",https://lamarina.eldiario.es/2025/04/29/la-ong-calpina-visio-sense-fronteres-devuelve-la-vision-a-148-refugiados-en-kakuma-kenia/,eldiario.es,"Tue, 29 Apr 2025 07:58:46 GMT"

Taban – the head of Infrastructure Cluster – was stressing the need for the removal of illegal checkpoints along the vital route, during his closing remarks at the first National Trade Forum 2025 in Juba, on Monday.
He stated that the criminals demanded a ransom of $15,000 for the release of the vessel, even after already receiving $10,000 earlier.
The vessel, known as a steamer, was transporting supplies from Juba to an oilfield in the Upper Nile region. He added that the army is now working to remove illegal checkpoints and stop the collection of multiple taxes along the Nile River route to Malakal,
He emphasized that the river remains the only supply line for citizens in the area.
Taban also referenced the government’s earlier efforts last year to crack down on illegal roadblocks on major highways to reduce excessive taxation and lower goods prices across the country.
“Army is currently working on removing all checkpoints and collecting multiple taxes on the Nile River to Malakal because the river is the only way to supply the citizens there with their needs,” he said.
“From here, there are some criminals who claim that they are the government. There was a steam traveling from Juba to Upper Nile, transporting things belonging to the GPOC. Currently, the steamer has been detained for the sixth month and the criminals refused to release it and demanded a ransom of $15,000 this morning after he paid them $10,000.”
On April 25, the Chief of Defense Force of South Sudan People’s Defense Forces (SSPDF) Lt. Gen. Paul Nang Majok, ordered the immediate removal of all checkpoints along the White Nile river from Central Equatoria up to Upper Nile.
Gen. Nang has directed SSPDF Commander of Ground Forces Lt. Gen. Theyip Gatluak and Assistant Chief of Defense Force for Disarmament and Mobilization Gen. Johnson Olony to promptly commence the removal of all checkpoints along the Nile.
The checkpoints removal will start from Juba County in Central Equatoria all the way to Malakal County in Upper Nile, according to the order availed to the media by SSPDF Spokesperson Maj. Gen. Lul Ruai Koang.
A researcher from the Danish Institute for International Studies found in a 2021 publication that illegal checkpoints taxes in South Sudan were the most expensive in the world.
Since independence in 2011, the number of checkpoints has nearly doubled and checkpoint taxes have increased by 300%, the study found, adding that these ‘transit taxes’ are mostly illegal.
For two years, the study mapped 319 checkpoints along major trade routes in South Sudan, of which 253 (79%) are roadblocks and 66 (21%) river checkpoints.
In December 2024, delegates to the 8th Governors Forum resolved numerous communiques including calling on the national government to remove illegal road blocks and ban illegal taxes to boost the economy.",https://www.eyeradio.org/vp-taban-says-armed-men-holding-boat-carrying-gpoc-fuel-for-6-months/,eyeradio.org,"Tue, 29 Apr 2025 07:05:59 GMT"

The Stakes of Stripping Climate from UN Peacekeeping in South Sudan - South Sudan,"News and Press Release in English on South Sudan about Climate Change and Environment, Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding, Flood and more; published on 28 Apr 2025 by ICG","The UN Security Council will soon vote on the future of the peacekeeping mission in conflict-hit South Sudan. In this Q&A, Nazanine Moshiri discusses what is at stake and why climate and peace should remain part of the mission’s work.
What is at stake?
On 30 April, the UN Security Council is set to renew the mandate of the UN Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS), a peacekeeping operation established in 2011 to support the world’s newest country immediately after its independence. Since its creation, South Sudan has struggled with bouts of instability and, as Crisis Group has warned, the country is once again on the brink of full-blown conflict. During a period of wavering backing for UN peacekeeping operations across Africa, and with U.S. funding for them under threat, South Sudan’s precarious condition would likely worsen without the mission’s presence, despite the fact that it has not always been able to staunch the risk of violence.
Rising hostilities in the Upper Nile region highlight the growing challenges for UNMISS in protecting civilians. But it should not be forgotten that this escalation in violence is coming at a time when natural disasters are compounding the population’s immiseration and fuelling instability. The World Food Programme reports that South Sudan is at a “critical tipping point”, with nearly 7.7 million people, half the population, facing hunger because of flooding and conflict, including approximately 3.1 million in the Upper Nile. Severe flooding in 2024 uprooted about a million South Sudanese from their homes, with floodwaters cutting off major roads and contributing to an outbreak of cholera. This disaster has deepened the humanitarian crisis and made it even harder to deliver aid to affected communities.
While much of the violence UNMISS responds to is driven by wrangling among the country’s political elites, the mission’s attention has increasingly been drawn toward a range of conflicts that are intimately connected with extreme weather events, specifically floods and droughts. Even so, this part of UNMISS’s work could come under threat should the U.S. – the Security Council lead on the South Sudan file – use the opportunity of mandate renewal to scale back the mission’s climate-related work as part of President Donald Trump’s general hostility to policies aimed at curbing the emission of greenhouse gases.
Until now, the mission has been at the vanguard of UN peace operations in dealing with the links between climate, peace and security. Since its creation, UNMISS has had to handle the harmful effects of environmental pressures on humanitarian crises and conflict. In 2020, the Security Council recognised the role of extreme weather in worsening instability. By 2023, it had directed UNMISS to assess and report on climate-related risks to peace and security. Its 2024 mandate for the mission includes the strongest UN position on climate issues in both peacekeeping and political missions yet seen, acknowledging the impact of climate change, land degradation, food insecurity and natural disasters on stability and calling for a better understanding of how the climate could threaten peace and security.
Why is the climate issue so divisive on the Security Council?
Achieving consensus among Security Council members for action on climate, peace and security has been an uphill battle, and political divisions continue to bedevil efforts to reach a common position. In 2020, the U.S. threatened to veto a draft resolution on managing the security implications of climate change that Germany (an elected member of the Council from 2019-2020) and nine other states drafted. In 2021, Niger and Ireland proposed a similar text that would have bolstered the UN’s efforts to analyse the linkages between climate change and international peace and security. Russia and India voted against the resolution, and China abstained despite support for the text among the wider UN membership. These three states argued that climate change should be addressed in settings designed for the issue, such as the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, not those focused on international peace and security.
Since then, Council members have gradually incorporated specific climate concerns into the mandates of some UN peace operations. But despite these steps, China, Russia and various elected members have baulked at giving the Security Council the authority to impose climate-related obligations on other states.
Meanwhile, Trump’s return to the White House will likely halt further discussions on the issue. As happened during Trump’s first administration, the U.S. is likely to downplay the significance of climate change, or even its existence, and it could try to limit action at the Security Council and other international fora. The new U.S. stance already became visible in negotiations over the mandate renewal for the UN mission in Afghanistan in March, when Washington insisted on removing the phrase “environmental degradation” from the text; in the end, it agreed to a resolution highlighting how floods and droughts can exacerbate “food insecurity, water scarcity and land degradation”.
Why do connections between climate risks and conflict matter in South Sudan?
While most violence in South Sudan is tied to the transactional deals that political leaders hatch and break, and their effects on extensive patronage networks, climate pressures are making things worse, forcing people to move and putting more strain on land and water, which means that even small disputes over resources can turn violent. South Sudan faces some of the world’s most intense climate-related security risks, with consequences that often shape and aggravate other sources of conflict.
Climate shocks, especially extreme flooding, are the most urgent threat, affecting 1.4 million people in 2024 and displacing 380,000 people. This displacement has fuelled tensions by pushing people off their land and into areas populated by communities that are already struggling with a lack of pasture and fewer water resources, such as in Lakes, Central Equatoria, Unity, Jonglei and Warrap states, where displaced groups seek higher ground to avoid the floodwaters.
While communities living in floodplains have traditionally adapted to shifting weather conditions, climate extremes disrupt this balance. Rising waters no longer follow familiar patterns but displace people more frequently, making it harder for them to rebuild their livelihoods. Relocation because of severe flooding has already become a flashpoint for conflict. A 2022 relocation from Bor to Mangala led to clashes after the authorities did not consult Mangala residents, who saw the new arrivals as a threat to their scarce resources. The risks are particularly acute in Greater Equatoria, where Dinka resettlement — especially from Bor — has been a source of political tensions since the 1960s and remains a driver of bouts of violence.
Historically severe flooding that began in 2019 has also heightened the effects of conflict. Floods in the country’s western plains, for instance, shaped the struggle between President Salva Kiir and Akol Koor, then his intelligence chief, as they fought for influence among the Dinka communities there, intensifying blockades of territory and worsening the conflict’s humanitarian fallout. By the end of 2020, the UN found mass starvation in several communities affected by the violence. Disaster-related displacement, food insecurity and livelihood losses have, in turn, exacerbated sexual exploitation and violence against women and girls.
These climate-related strains on communities have since been compounded by displacement from the civil war in neighbouring Sudan. More than one million people have fled into South Sudan since that conflict started in April 2023 – heaping additional pressure on security, resources and humanitarian aid. Meanwhile, some South Sudanese have joined opposing sides in the Sudanese conflict – raising fears they could return home armed to a country suffering higher levels of hunger and beset by the problems of relocating displaced people.
South Sudan’s government, for its part, has been unwilling or unable to respond to climate threats. UN officials estimate that South Sudan needs $50 billion to mitigate and adapt to climate change, but it has received a tiny fraction of that amount. In March, the Green Climate Fund, based in South Korea, promised an initial $7 million to boost future climate investment in the country by the end of 2025. Even if the money flows, South Sudan’s government lacks the capacity to implement meaningful adaptation efforts. Donors also know that funnelling funds through state institutions would result in much of it being lost to corruption, just as vast sums of humanitarian aid have sustained South Sudan’s kleptocratic elite. Some local authorities are willing to act, but they have almost no resources and receive little support from the Juba government, leaving many communities to fend for themselves.
How is UNMISS helping South Sudan respond to climate challenges?
UNMISS is, in some ways, already aligning parts of its mandate with the need to respond to South Sudan’s climate shocks, though its role remains limited. With almost 18,000 peacekeepers, the mission often steps in where local authorities cannot. For example, heavy rains and Nile flooding have repeatedly breached flood defences in Bentiu, home to nearly 150,000 displaced people. In 2022, UNMISS troops discovered a dyke failure late at night. The gap widened rapidly, threatening thousands. Hundreds of peacekeepers and camp residents worked to contain the damage. UNMISS engineers have since reinforced more than 96km of dykes, raising them to 4m, although officials warn they may not hold against future floods.
UNMISS has also taken steps to incorporate better analysis of climate security. It is the only blue-helmet operation with a dedicated climate adviser, funded by Ireland through the Climate Security Mechanism. It also has two additional staff members, supported by Norway. The team assesses how flooding, drought and other pressures drive local conflicts and then helps UN peacekeepers to respond. For example, in September 2024, UNMISS’s climate peace and security unit supported a peace dialogue in Yirol, Lakes State, as floods displaced cattle herders from Unity State, straining resources and stoking tensions. UNMISS has also sought to bolster the role of women and of youth, two groups particularly affected by resource-related tensions, in peaceful conflict resolution.
What happens if UNMISS’s climate work is weakened or eliminated?
UNMISS’s ability to build climate risks into its security planning depends on clear leadership and operational support from UN headquarters, member states and troop-contributing countries. Regardless of how dire conditions in South Sudan may become as a result of climate shocks to a war-torn country, without the Security Council’s explicit backing it is doubtful whether these three will continue to support the mission in responding to such emergencies. This possible retreat reflects a broader trend. As the U.S. once again steps back from international agreements on combating climate change, the existing resistance from permanent members of the Security Council has become a more general threat to global cooperation on the issue. Among the plethora of things at stake is the fate of long-term international commitments and funding to address the ways climate crises aggravate armed conflict.
If the Security Council weakens or altogether strips references to climate from the UNMISS mandate, backsliding will become more likely in other cases. Seven UN missions in Africa mention climate security, and four of them have dedicated climate advisers. Losing the references to climate in South Sudan could weaken UN efforts to address climate-driven instability continent-wide at a moment when the number of Africans displaced within their own countries has tripled in fifteen years, driven in large part by war and climate shocks. The UN, for example, says 9.1 million Somalis, almost half of the country’s population, have been either displaced or had their livelihoods affected by conflict, floods, drought and disease outbreaks. The Somali militant group Al-Shabaab also uses access to water and other natural resources to levy taxes and fees on herders and farmers, as well as to punish communities that resist its control. In Cameroon’s Far North region, to take another example, conflicts over scarce water resources have displaced herders, farmers and fisherfolk.
Data from the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre puts the figure of internally displaced Africans even higher, at 35 million – up from 11.6 million in 2009. Even so, UN officials in Nairobi told Crisis Group that they are under internal pressure to change language in documents and programming from “climate or environment” to vague references to “vulnerabilities linked to natural resources”, a move intended to appease the U.S.
In South Sudan, meanwhile, troop-contributing countries already have a lower risk appetite, making UNMISS reluctant to engage in the most unsafe parts of the country. Removing wording on climate from UNMISS’s mandate would make its ability to tackle climate-related security risks even harder to sustain, particularly by hindering UNMISS’s case for getting funding to continue these efforts. As part of its 2024-2025 budget, UNMISS requested funding for more than 35 different capacity-building exercises, community dialogues and studies about climate, peace and security. Member states that are suspicious of the mission’s climate-related efforts would likely attempt to strip out these initiatives during the budget negotiations in June, should the Security Council cut references to climate concerns.
How can UNMISS prepare itself?
UNMISS should focus on protecting civilians and easing rising ethnic tensions, South Sudan’s most acute and immediate threats to peace. To this end, the mission says it is engaging with key national forces and working alongside international and regional partners, including the African Union, the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (a regional body aiming to promote development and peace), heads of state and the UN Security Council.
Nothing precludes the mission from seeking to incorporate environmental considerations into its peacekeeping efforts, even if references to the word “climate” are stripped from its mandate. There are various ways it can do so. First, peace dialogues facilitated by UNMISS to tackle resource-based violence may require that the mission follow up to ensure that climate resilience projects are completed. These dialogues can still make progress despite the conflict, and should be a first step in setting up projects such as improving drainage – helping floodwaters recede while protecting traditional livelihoods that depend on seasonal floods. Development partners and local authorities can see these projects through once they are agreed upon.
Critics say these dialogues fail to address elite control of land and resources, which drives a large share of the tensions between communities by feeding disputes over territory, grazing routes or water. Peace dialogues also fail when they exclude the leaders of armed youth groups – without them, any agreement becomes cosmetic rather than a basis for lasting solutions. Still, these dialogues have some value. While they are unlikely to change South Sudan’s entrenched political competition – the real engine of violence – they may help mitigate flare-ups of conflict related to water and land in the short term.
Secondly, UNMISS should ask for donor-backed technical support in flood and drought forecasting, providing for more systematic climate security analysis and scenario exercises. Long-term flood preparedness will require partnerships with scientific agencies like the IGAD’s Climate Prediction and Applications Centre, which is working with the South Sudanese government to improve forecasting. There is a dearth of hydrological and weather data in many regions of South Sudan.
Thirdly, although UNMISS peacekeepers and police do not need to become climate experts, they should seek to understand how floods and droughts shape organised violence and their operational responses. They should provide training on basic climate risks for new personnel. The mission’s engineers should also, where possible, assist in flood responses while improving the ways in which disaster operations pay heed to local conflict patterns. Infrastructure decisions, such as where to build dykes or repair flood defences, can shape population movements and disputes over land and resources. If the mission’s climate security adviser remains, he or she should support consultations with local communities to assess the risks that flooding may worsen conflict as well as how to plan relocations of people to avoid triggering intercommunal tensions. The government and its partners should strive to relocate displaced people only to areas where they have social ties and a receptive local community.
Finally, UNMISS should assist humanitarian and development organisations operating in climate-affected areas wherever possible. Without UN patrols or security escorts, aid groups struggle to reach at-risk populations, leaving communities for the most part to manage the effects of climate crises alone. The mission should expand patrols and provide escorts for aid convoys, particularly in flood-affected states such as Unity, Warrap and Jonglei, and strengthen cooperation with local responders. If security conditions allow, the mission should also commit to monthly expeditions to specific high-risk areas. Doing so would enable local groups to coordinate their work in partnership with these patrols, allowing humanitarian relief to reach the country’s most vulnerable people.
Across South Sudan, floods are cutting off access to hard-hit areas, displacement is fuelling tensions and armed groups are exploiting resource shortages. Even if the UN Security Council removes an explicit focus on “climate” as part of UNMISS’s mandate, the mission’s goal of shoring up stability in South Sudan makes it unavoidable that peacekeepers continue to tackle the ways that climate shocks are making the country more unsafe.",https://reliefweb.int/report/south-sudan/stakes-stripping-climate-un-peacekeeping-south-sudan,reliefweb.int,"Tue, 29 Apr 2025 00:46:42 GMT"

Abyei: Traders count losses after fire ravages Amiet market - Radio Tamazuj,Traders and residents in Ameth Aguok County in the contested area of Abyei are assessing,"Traders and residents in Ameth Aguok County in the contested area of Abyei are assessing extensive damage after a series of fires tore through the Amiet market over the weekend, officials said Monday.



Osman Chol, chairperson of the Abyei Chamber of Commerce, told Radio Tamazuj that the fires destroyed a wide range of goods, inflicting heavy losses on local businesses. The cause of the blazes remains unclear, and no arrests have been made, he said.



“The fire broke out Friday night—the seventh such incident to occur after dark. It is difficult to identify those responsible or estimate the full extent of the damage,” Chol said.



The fires affected businesses owned by both locals and foreign traders from Ethiopia and Eritrea, he added.



Chol urged market vendors to adhere to a new survey plan aimed at preventing future disasters. “Concrete shops are the solution to these repeated fire outbreaks,” he said.



While an exact financial toll was not available, Chol reported that roughly 150,000 sacks of sorghum, 200,000 sacks of sugar, 300,000 sacks of flour and over 150,000 jerricans of cooking oil were destroyed, along with large sums of cash in various currencies.



The flames also damaged nearby homes, and Chol called on county authorities to improve road access in the market area. He noted that the lack of a reliable communication network in Amiet hampers emergency response efforts.



Athiak Kuol, a local tea vendor, said her stall and all its contents—including cups, plates and kettles—were reduced to ashes.

Government changes tone on 'hostile' Nuer areas remark - Radio Tamazuj,South Sudan’s government on Monday sought to clarify a cabinet minister’s remarks labeling some Nuer-majority,"South Sudan’s government on Monday sought to clarify a cabinet minister’s remarks labeling some Nuer-majority counties as “hostile,” denying the statement targeted the entire Nuer ethnic group amid growing criticism over ethnic profiling.



The controversy follows heightened tensions after President Salva Kiir placed First Vice President Riek Machar under house arrest on March 26, accusing him of ties to a March 4 attack by the White Army—a Nuer youth militia—on a military garrison in Nasir County, Upper Nile State.



Kiir and Machar, along with other leaders, signed a 2018 peace deal to end a civil war, but key issues, including unifying armed forces and preparing elections, remain unresolved.



On Saturday, Cabinet Affairs Minister Martin Elia Lomuro named Nasir, Ulang, Akobo, Nyirol, Uror, Fangak, Ayod, Rubkona, and Panyijiar counties as “hostile,” while Maiwut, Longechuk, Guit, Leer, Mayendit, Koch, and Mayom were designated as “friendly” to the government.



He also accused communities in the “hostile” areas of ties to Machar’s SPLM-IO party and rejecting government authority.



“This community [Nuer] is divided into four sub-sections and has deliberately refused to recognize the government. That is why they can boldly attack and kill government forces,” Lomuro said.



The remarks drew widespread condemnation, with critics accusing the government of stoking ethnic divisions. Analysts warn that inflammatory rhetoric risks further destabilizing a country already struggling with fragile peace.



On Monday, Youth and Sports Minister Joseph Geng Akech said the term “hostile” referred only to organized armed groups, not the Nuer community as a whole.



“The government’s reference to hostile communities pertains to specific organized groups, not an entire ethnic group,” Akech told reporters in Juba. He said such cases would be addressed through reconciliation efforts under the 2018 peace deal.",https://www.radiotamazuj.org/en/news/article/government-changes-tone-on-hostile-nuer-areas-remark,radiotamazuj.org,"Mon, 28 Apr 2025 22:10:22 GMT"
"Warrap speaker quits IO, claims interim leader ordered his arrest - Radio Tamazuj","The speaker of South Sudan’s Warrap State Legislative Assembly, Kuec Deng Mayar, said on Monday","The speaker of South Sudan’s Warrap State Legislative Assembly, Kuec Deng Mayar, said on Monday that an interim leader of a breakaway faction of the SPLM-IO party ordered his arrest after he refused to endorse him.



Mayar, who resigned as the SPLM-IO’s state chairperson over the weekend, told Radio Tamazuj that Stephen Par Kuol, the faction’s interim leader, instructed security forces through the state governor to detain him earlier this month. He was later released.



Par Kuol, the national minister of peacebuilding, was declared interim chairman by a faction of the SPLM-IO after First Vice President and SPLM-IO leader Riek Machar was placed under house arrest in March.



President Salva Kiir accused Machar of orchestrating attacks by the Nuer White Army militia on government forces in Nasir.



Mayar said Par Kuol had demanded his endorsement to solidify his leadership claim. “I told him I needed to consult my members, but they rejected it. That’s why he ordered the governor to arrest me,” Mayar said.



Mayar also announced the closure of SPLM-IO offices in Warrap, accusing the party of abandoning its principles. “The party has lost its direction. It’s now about power struggles and tribalism,” he said, alleging that Par Kuol’s faction favored Nuer interests.



Elizabeth Achuei Yol, a senior SPLM-IO official loyal to Machar, dismissed Mayar’s claims, calling the office closures a “personal decision” unsupported by the party. She said most members in Warrap remained loyal to Machar.

Torit Health Institute graduates over 400 medical students - Radio Tamazuj,More than 400 medical students graduated on Saturday from Torit Health Science Institute (THSI) in,"More than 400 medical students graduated on Saturday from Torit Health Science Institute (THSI) in Eastern Equatoria State, after completing three-year diploma programs aimed at addressing healthcare shortages in the state.


The 404 graduates specialized in clinical medicine, public health, midwifery, nursing, pharmacy, and medical laboratory technology. Officials said the newly trained professionals would help improve health services in the state.


This marks the institute’s fifth graduation since its founding in 2015, with the latest ceremony combining the 2023 and 2024 cohorts.


Ochan Denis, THSI’s academic registrar, noted a steady rise in enrollment. “Two years ago, we graduated a significant number, and today we have 404 graduates,” he said. “Each year, the numbers increase—this is positive news for the health ministry.”


The graduating class included 120 nurses, 104 midwives, 123 clinicians, 30 medical laboratory technicians, and 27 pharmacists. Of the total, 219 were male and 185 female—a trend Denis welcomed, encouraging more women to join the medical field.


Ewot James Solomon, a newly certified midwife and student representative, described the journey as challenging but rewarding. “It hasn’t been easy—there was stress and pressure—but thanks to our tutors, we’ve gained the skills to serve our communities,” he said.


THSI Principal Tobias Magezi Omal commended the graduates for their perseverance. “You arrived with dreams and leave equipped to serve humanity,” he said, urging them to uphold integrity and excellence despite economic hardships.


Dr. Elijo Omoro Tahir, acting director-general of the state health ministry, praised the institute’s role in training mid-level health workers, particularly for rural areas. “You are now the future of healthcare in Eastern Equatoria and beyond,” he told the graduates.",https://www.radiotamazuj.org/en/news/article/torit-health-institute-graduates-over-400-medical-students,radiotamazuj.org,"Mon, 28 Apr 2025 14:52:19 GMT"

Rebecca Joshua Okwaci reiterated the appeal – which she made two weeks ago when she and other leaders from the Chollo community urged urgent government intervention to de-escalate tensions and support peace efforts across the state.
The leaders also appealed to humanitarian agencies to step in and assist civilians affected by the ongoing insecurity.
Their call followed reported violence allegedly carried out by SPLA-IO forces and allied armed groups, targeting unified forces in several counties, including Panyikang, Makal, Fashoda, and Manyo.
On Sunday, April 27, lawmaker Okwaci expressed gratitude to the government for restoring calm in many areas, including Nasir and Ulang counties. She said that parts of Panyikang County are still experiencing some pockets of insecurity.
She urged the national authorities to speed up efforts to secure the remaining areas, stressing the urgency to allow displaced residents to return home and farm.
“We made some media statement calling on the state government to intervene in protecting the civilians who fled and displace by the conflicts , and in a very short time, they have managed to respond,” she said.
“We thank them for their serious move. Now, the fighting in Ulang and Nasir is no more, we remain with some issues in Panyikang County  and some neighboring areas. We are calling for full stability in our state so that people can be able to go back home and start farming.”",https://www.eyeradio.org/mp-okwachi-urges-full-stability-in-upper-nile-state/,eyeradio.org,"Mon, 28 Apr 2025 14:30:12 GMT"
"Trinidad and Tobago Faces a “Youth Emergency,” Says Opposition Leader Persad-Bissessar","Trinidad and Tobago — Opposition Leader Kamla Persad-Bissessar has declared that Trinidad and Tobago is facing a “youth emergency,” citing a growing crisis where young people, deprived of opportunities, are increasingly drawn into gang culture. Speaking at a campaign event at Vickar’s car park in the critical battleground constituency of Moruga/Tableland, the former Prime Minister pledged to tackle the issue within the first 120 days of a United National Congress (UNC) government. She warned that when young people turn to criminality as a form of employment, the country is witnessing not merely a crime problem, but “a crisis of opportunity and dignity.” “The UNC will disrupt the pipeline to gangs and replace it with a pathway to growth,” Persad-Bissessar promised. “We will make being skilled, educated, and employed more rewarding than being feared. And we will give every young person a chance to belong, to contribute, and to lead.” Persad-Bissessar criticized the ruling People’s National Movement (PNM) for allowing a youth emergency to escalate, citing the collapse of skills training programmes and the disillusionment of graduates facing limited job prospects. She pointed to a culture of instant gratification and survivalism that has fueled gang membership, stressing that youth — not the elderly — are driving surges in home invasions and gun trafficking. Under a UNC government, she said, a National Youth Empowerment & Transformation Plan would be launched to holistically support young people through employment generation, skills training, and paid apprenticeships. Among the initiatives, the Youth Employment Initiative (YEI) aims to create thousands of entry-level and part-time jobs for individuals aged 16 to 30. Persad-Bissessar also pledged to make housing more accessible to young people and committed to direct intervention efforts targeting at-risk youth in high-crime areas. In a direct appeal to first-time voters — many of whom were children when the PNM took office in 2015 — she urged them to envision a better Trinidad and Tobago. “What you see happening today with all this hardship, out-of-control crime, home invasions, murders, joblessness, and hopelessness is not how Trinidad and Tobago used to be,” she said. Differentiating the UNC from the PNM, she asserted, “The UNC serves the people whilst the PNM serves the ‘Fake elite’ and party financiers.” She added: “Ask yourself this question: If you wanted someone to look after the welfare of your children, would you entrust their safety to the bully Stuart Young or to me, who loves you and your children? With all humility, I think you know that the answer is me.” Persad-Bissessar emphasized that restoring hope and dignity to young people would be central to her administration’s agenda, offering a vision of opportunity over desperation.",,https://nycaribnews.com/trinidad-and-tobago-faces-a-youth-emergency-says-opposition-leader-persad-bissessar/,nycaribnews.com,"Mon, 28 Apr 2025 13:16:53 GMT"
SPLM-IO nullifies closure of offices in Warrap State – Sudans Post,The Sudan People’s Liberation Movement in Opposition (SPLM-IO) in Warrap State has dismissed the statement declaring the shutdown of the party’s offices in Warrap State.,"The move comes a day after Kuec Deng Mayar, the Speaker of Awarrap State Transitional Legislative Assembly who is the SPLM-IO former chairperson and his associates in the state, rolled down the party’s flag, signaling an end of operation.

Elizabeth Achuei Yol, SPLM-IO Political Bureau member. [Photo: Courtesy]KUAJOK – The Sudan People’s Liberation Movement in Opposition (SPLM-IO) in Warrap State has dismissed the statement declaring the shutdown of the party’s offices in Warrap State.


The move comes a day after Kuec Deng Mayar, the Speaker of Awarrap State Transitional Legislative Assembly, who is the SPLM-IO former chairperson and his associates in the state, rolled down the party’s flag, signalling an end to operation.
Elizabeth Achuei Yol, the former national Ministry of Health on the SPLM-IO ticket, claimed that the decision to shut down the offices was unilateral.
Achuei said it was not within the powers of the former chairperson to decide the fate of the country’s biggest armed opposition group.


“As per the mentioned statement by former speaker of Warrap, Hon Kuec Deng Mayar, and former chairperson has no authority to close down the SPLM/IO offices, either in the state, counties, payams, or without an integral approach from IO entire leadership in Warrap,” she said in a statement seen by Sudans Post.
“The decision taken by Kuech Deng Mayar is personal and has no connection with SPLM/IO members in Warrap,” she added.
Achuei claimed that there was no consensus reached by the state party structure to close operations, adding that the figure cited by Mr. Deng was inflated, underscoring that the former chairperson’s contributions have been underwhelming.


“Former Hon. Speaker and former Chairperson of Warrap State, Kuec Deng Mayar, has never officially launched any party secretariat in Warrap State. His claim that 2,338 have agreed to officially close down the IO offices in Warrap is baseless and unfounded. Even during the formation of the national caucus, his county had fewer than five members,” she asserted.
“Therefore, as a supervisor and political bureau member, National Liberation Council and National MP, the majority of SPLM-IO leadership and members from Warrap State are loyal to the leadership of Dr Riek Machar, the Chairperson and C in C of the SPLM/A-IO,” Achuei affirmed.
Mr Deng was arrested and detained by government security forces before defecting from the Machar-led opposition, citing internal divisions prior to the office shutdown announcement.",https://www.sudanspost.com/splm-io-nullifies-closure-of-offices-in-warrap-state/,sudanspost.com,"Mon, 28 Apr 2025 13:01:51 GMT"
RJMEC report on the status of implementation of the revitalised agreement on the resolution of the conflict in the Republic of South Sudan for the Period 1st January to 31st March 2025 - South Sudan,"Situation Report in English on South Sudan about Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding, Protection and Human Rights and Epidemic; published on 28 Apr 2025 by RJMEC","Executive Summary This report covers the status of implementation of the Revitalised Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan (R-ARCSS) during the period 1st January to 31st March 2025 and builds on similar previous Reports Nos. 001/19 - 025/24 prepared since the signing of the R-ARCSS on 12th September 2018. In addition to the status update on implementation, it highlights the activities of the Reconstituted Joint Monitoring and Evaluation Commission (RJMEC) in the fulfilment of its oversight, monitoring and evaluation mandate within the R-ARCSS; and concludes by providing key recommendations on returning the country on a sustained path to peace.
During the quarter, implementation of the Agreement ground to a halt, as the Parties engaged in repeated violations and the political and security environment markedly worsened. In scenes not seen since the signing of the R-ARCSS over six years ago, armed conflict and violence erupted across the country, several high-ranking opposition members and Parliamentarians were detained and imprisoned and the First Vice President Dr Riek Machar Teny was put under house arrest. In addition, ministerial positions at the state and national levels and those within the Presidency were reshuffled, and portfolios within some Agreement institutions and mechanisms were abandoned. In some parts of the country, civilians including women and children have borne the brunt of the fallout and have suffered serious human rights and humanitarian law violations including death, injury and displacement due to military operations and connected armed clashes.
Recent political developments in the country include political appointments and replacements at the national and gubernatorial levels, including that of the Presidency, Council of Ministers, States and Administrative Areas. Some replacements, however, involved a party to the R-ARCSS replacing its own appointees, whereas in others, the replacements were drawn from different parties, in some cases, female office bearers were replaced by male appointees signalling a deviation from the responsibility sharing arrangements including the 35% minimum threshold for women agreed among the parties, pursuant to the R-ARCSS. It should be noted that the Revitalized Peace Agreement is premised on the principles of collegiality, consultation and consensus.
Security violations to the Agreement have reportedly been made by both the South Sudan Peoples Defense Forces (SSPDF) and the Sudan People’s Liberation Army – In Opposition (SPLA -IO), which now threatens the peace and stability of South Sudan. In addition, there has been no progress regarding the unification and deployment of forces, which under the R-ARCSS was intended to bring the former warring parties together under one unified command. Phase I deployment has not been completed, and Phase II training has not yet started.
Following the outbreak of violence and worsening in the political environment, the RJMEC embarked on a series of diplomatic engagements aimed at seeking solutions to stem the crisis and return the country on a path to sustainable peace. This included the involvement of the IGAD Heads of State and Government, the African Union, the United Nations and key international players. Among the outcomes were the holding of an Extraordinary Summit of the IGAD Heads of State and Government, the convening of the AU Peace and Security Council, shuttle diplomacy by various regional Special Envoys to Juba, the AU Panel of the Wise and a two-day visit by H.E. Yoweri Kaguta Museveni, President of the Republic of Uganda. Those efforts notwithstanding, the political and security situation remained largely unchanged.
South Sudan continued to face a severe humanitarian crisis, which has been further escalated by widespread violence, intercommunal clashes, land disputes, insecurity, natural disasters, cholera outbreak and cross-border movements. The widespread violence led to increased numbers of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) requiring urgent humanitarian assistance.
Concerning Economic and Financial Management, the Public Financial Management Oversight Committee, which comprises the Revitalized Transitional Government of National Unity (RTGoNU) and its development partners identified several priorities in their mid-term strategy. Of these nine are contained in the provisions of the R-ARCSS and the assessment focuses on the implementation of these provisions. Progress has also been made with the implementation of the Treasury Single Account (TSA), which is a bank account or a set of linked bank accounts through which the government maintains its receipts and payments.
Very little progress was registered in the implementation of tasks associated with Transitional Justice, Accountability, Reconciliation and Healing. At the same time, the National Constitutional Review Commission (NCRC) publicly launched its civic education and public consultation process on the making of a permanent Constitution.
There is no doubt that the R-ARCSS remains the most viable framework to steer South Sudan towards the path of stability and prosperity. However, the current political and security situation is fragile and highly volatile, posing a serious threat to the survivability of the R-ARCSS. The ongoing political conflicts are also eroding opportunities the extension provided to enhance the integration of gender equality perspectives into the peace process and better prepare women for meaningful participation in the transitional justice, constitution-making and political processes ahead of the anticipated elections in December 2026.
The recommendations that follow, if acted upon, including to the Parties to the Agreement, RTGoNU, Transitional National Legislature (TNL), Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), the African Union, and the International Partners, are geared towards putting an end to the deteriorating security and political situation as well as to encourage a faster pace of implementation of the R-ARCSS.
a. To the Parties to the Agreement and Relevant Stakeholders:
• Cease all forms of hostility and restore adherence to the Permanent Ceasefire and Transitional Security Arrangements;
• allow CTSAMVM the opportunity to investigate, verify and report findings on alleged violations of the provisions of the permanent ceasefire;

– Teetering towards war –
South Sudan has experienced a deteriorating security and political situation since February 2025 – following the outbreak of deadly violence in Upper Nile, Western Equatoria, Western Bahr el Ghazal, and cantonment sites in Central Equatoria.
This prompted the Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary General to warn that the country was on the brink of another civil war.
Nicholas Haysom, who is the Head of UN Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS), urged all parties in South Sudan to pull back from the brink and commit to peace before the country plunges into another devastating conflict, in a briefing to journalists in March.

Both Majak, Acting Minister of Health, commended the government and health partners for launching this initiative and urged mothers and fathers of children to bring their children for vaccination.

He continued, ""We thank the Ministry of Health and UNICEF for launching this campaign at this important time. We are approaching the rainy season, which is witnessing many cases. Health teams will be traveling to the designated areas, so bring your children to receive measles vaccination.""

He added, ""We assure you of everyone's safety during the campaign, and we appreciate UNICEF's continued support for our people. We also urge other partners to continue doing their utmost given the numerous disease outbreaks.""

For her part, Dr. Kawa Kuol, UNICEF Representative, affirmed UNICEF's commitment to its partnership with the National Ministry of Health to provide essential health services and improve primary health care.

She added, ""UNICEF is committed to ensuring the effectiveness of the vaccination chain, the availability of vaccines, and their access to all children. This is a collective responsibility, and I am very pleased to see the launch of the campaign after long preparations by the health sector in Lakes State.""

""Let's ensure that all targeted children are vaccinated against measles. We all know that measles is a deadly disease, and it affects children,"" she said.

Makere Malok, Director General of the Ministry of Health in Lakes State, said that measles is a public health concern, having affected many children in the first four months of 2025 in various counties.

He continued, ""We have recorded 32 cases of measles in Rumbek East County, 27 cases in Rumbek Central County, 12 cases in Chuebet County, and one case in Wollo County, where a sample has been collected. We are still awaiting the results.""

South Sudan government classifies Nuer areas as 'hostile' and 'friendly' - Radio Tamazuj,The South Sudanese government has classified Nuer areas as “hostile” or “friendly” amid escalating tensions.,"The South Sudanese government has classified Nuer areas as either ""hostile"" or ""friendly"" amid escalating tensions between President Salva Kiir and his first vice president, Riek Machar (a Nuer), following recent violence in Nasir.

Kiir placed Machar under house arrest last month, accusing him of inciting rebellion against the government to undermine peace.

In a press conference in Juba on Saturday, Cabinet Affairs Minister Martin Elia Lomuro said Nasir, Ulang, Akobo, Nyirol, Uror, Fangak, Ayod, Rubkona, and Panyijar counties were ""hostile"" to the government, while Maiwut, Longchuk, Guit, Leer, Mayendit, Koch, and Mayom counties were classified as ""friendly.""

Lomuro, a close ally of Kiir, accused communities in the ""hostile"" counties of refusing to recognize the government, leading to attacks on security forces. He specifically blamed Machar's SPLM-IO for controlling these areas.

""The Nuer community, divided into four sub-communities, has deliberately refused to recognize the government, which is why they can attack and kill government forces with such audacity,"" he said.

The national minister cited a March 4 attack in Nasir County by the ""White Army""—a militia of armed Nuer youth—that reportedly killed more than 400 South Sudan People's Defense Forces (SPDF) soldiers, including the base commander, Major General David Majur Dak.

He described the killings as ""treason"" and warned that the incident threatened to undermine the fragile peace process.

""In a place like Nasir, close to Ethiopia and Sudan, these soldiers were our protectors from external threats, and they were arrested, isolated, and slaughtered while the world watched,"" he said.

Lomuro, who serves as secretary-general of the High Implementation Committee for the Peace Agreement, said the 2018 agreement should not be hindered by infighting within the SPLM-IO party led by Machar, which he said had split into factions following the Nasir attack.

He indicated that his committee would meet soon to determine which SPLM-IO faction would be engaged with to move forward with the peace agreement.",https://www.radiotamazuj.org/ar/news/article/%d8%ad%d9%83%d9%88%d9%85%d8%a9-%d8%ac%d9%86%d9%88%d8%a8-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%b3%d9%88%d8%af%d8%a7%d9%86-%d8%aa%d8%b5%d9%86%d9%81-%d9%85%d9%86%d8%a7%d8%b7%d9%82-%d8%a7%d9%84%d9%86%d9%88%d9%8a%d8%b1-%d8%a5,radiotamazuj.org,"Mon, 28 Apr 2025 10:50:17 GMT"
"South Sudan: Protection Monitoring Spotlight, January - March 2025 - South Sudan",Situation Report in English on South Sudan about Protection and Human Rights; published on 28 Apr 2025 by Protection Cluster and UNHCR,"In March 2025, the South Sudan Protection Cluster with support of its AoRs and cluster members has concluded the first quarter of Protection Risk Assessments across South Sudan. The findings were analysed by the Area of Responsibility (AoR) experts with the below six risks presenting the highest severity:
Gender-Based Violence
30 out of 79 counties (38%), in South Sudan reported a high to very high severity of gender-based violence (GBV), predominantly affecting women and girls. Contributing factors include gender inequality, harmful traditional practices, extreme poverty, the challenges of communal living and insufficient resources, especially for refugees, returnees and displaced individuals, and a rise in both inter-communal and state-armed conflicts. These issues persistently place GBV as a critical risk for the population.
Theft, Extortion, Forced Eviction or Destruction of Personal Property
Nationwide, 14 out of 79 counties (18%), indicated a high to very high level of risk related to housing, land, and property violations. Additionally, 45 counties, accounting for another 57%, report a medium level of exposure to these risks, further intensifying the vulnerability of the population. The majority of these violations are associated with the aftermath of conflicts and a wide range of tenure insecurities, which are exacerbated by gender inequality, a weak judiciary, tribalism, and a general absence of governance to safeguard property rights.
Child, Early or Forced Marriage
Extreme poverty, entrenched cultural practices, and the displacement of families and communities have led to 51 counties experiencing medium levels of risk, while 12 counties report high to very high exposure. This means that 80% of the country is grappling with serious issues, including those related to GBV, psychosocial support (PSS), and health concerns for girls and young women.",https://reliefweb.int/report/south-sudan/south-sudan-protection-monitoring-spotlight-january-march-2025,reliefweb.int,"Mon, 28 Apr 2025 10:42:37 GMT"

Emmanuel Taban said the vehicle was carrying civilian passengers from Yei to Umbachi, and added that the assailants are yet to be identified and arrested.
“During the attack, we lost one woman, and two others were injured. They are currently receiving treatment at the hospital here. However, the perpetrators have not been apprehended yet,” he said.
Taban confirmed that the two injured individuals—a woman and a boy—are currently receiving medical treatment at a hospital in Yei. He described the ambush as an isolated incident and a likely robbery.
Commissioner Taban also revealed that the perpetrators fled the scene. He reassured the public, stating that the situation has returned to normal, and the road is now safe for travel.
“This was an isolated case. Despite the losses, the road is safe, and people are moving freely. Typically, when such attacks occur, the perpetrators flee the scene.”
“Their goal was likely to loot the vehicle, but when the driver failed to stop, they opened fire. As a result, we lost the woman, while the other woman and the boy were injured.

Plea for Peace Renewed in South Sudan as Pope Francis’ Legacy Remembered,"In a solemn Mass held at St Theresa’s Cathedral in Juba, Sunday, South Sudanese leaders were urged to honor the legacy of the late Pope [...]","

In a solemn Mass held at St Theresa’s Cathedral in Juba, Sunday, South Sudanese leaders were urged to honor the legacy of the late Pope Francis by recommitting to peace and reconciliation.

The call was made by Archbishop Séamus Patrick Horgan, the Vatican’s diplomatic representative to South Sudan, who emphasized that the Pope’s longstanding desire for peace must now be translated into concrete action.

The pontiff’s historic 2023 visit to the country was recalled, during which he had passionately appealed for an end to the violence. His message, it was said, had been firmly delivered and remains deeply relevant amidst ongoing conflict.

The Pope’s death at the age of 88 was described as a moment of both grief and reflection, with religious leaders lamenting that his dream of a truly peaceful South Sudan remains unfulfilled. Archbishop Horgan reminded congregants of the extraordinary affection Pope Francis held for the people of South Sudan, and his 2019 gesture of kneeling to kiss the feet of the country’s leaders was remembered as a powerful symbol of humility and unity. However, it was noted that the gesture had not been heeded, as fresh clashes between government forces and the SPLM-IO continue to threaten the fragile 2018 peace agreement.

The Mass was attended by key national figures including President Salva Kiir and Vice-President Taban Deng Gai, but disappointment was expressed by worshippers that no renewed pledge for peace was made by the leadership. Bishops and clergy from multiple denominations called on the Transitional Government to act urgently to preserve the revitalized peace agreement, which was described as “seriously sick”.

It was stressed that the Pope’s vision for South Sudan—one of tolerance, dialogue, and unity—could still be realised if his message were embraced with sincerity and courage.",https://medafricatimes.com/39977-plea-for-peace-renewed-in-south-sudan-as-pope-francis-legacy-remembered.html,medafricatimes.com,"Mon, 28 Apr 2025 10:34:47 GMT"
RJMEC calls for urgent release of opposition detainees – Sudans Post,The South Sudan’s Reconstituted Joint Monitoring and Evaluation Commission (RJMEC) has called for the release of detained political and military officials from the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement/Army in Opposition (SPLM/A-IO).,"The peace-monitoring bodies under the interim chairmanship of Maj. Gen. (rtd) George Aggrey Owinow, urged the Kiir administration to honour the outcome of the 43rd Extraordinary Summit of IGAD Heads of State.


JUBA – The South Sudan’s Reconstituted Joint Monitoring and Evaluation Commission (RJMEC) has called for the release of detained political and military officials from the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement/Army in Opposition (SPLM/A-IO).
In a quarterly report released Monday on the status of the implementation of the Revitalised Agreement on the Resolution of Conflict in South Sudan (R-ARCSS), the peace-monitoring bodies under the interim chairmanship of Maj. Gen. (rtd) George Aggrey Owinow urged the Kiir administration to honour the outcome of the 43rd Extraordinary Summit of IGAD Heads of State.
“Pursuant to the Communiqué of the 43rd Extraordinary Summit of IGAD Heads of State and Government on the Situation in the Republic of South Sudan, immediately release the SPLM/A-IO leaders and military officials currently in detention, unless credible evidence warrants legal proceedings conducted transparently and in accordance with due process,” the report partly read.
According to Human Rights Watch, about 17 political and military personnel remain incarcerated in the capital, Juba, without trial. The detainees include Dr. Riek Machar, the First Vice President and SPLM-IO Chairman, Gabriel Duop Lam, the Lt. Gen. Deputy Chief of Staff of the Unified Army Structures and Acting Chief of Staff for SPLA-IO.
Puot Kang Chol, the Petroleum Minister, Mam Pal Dhuor, a member of SPLA-IO, and Camilo Gatmach, a friend of Puot Kang Chol, remain in detention. Kang’s bodyguards Nelson Malou, Kun Tut, and Peter Magong are among those detained without charges.
Other detainees include Kang’s family members, Koang Puk, Biluny Puk, and Buay Thiechuong, with five unidentified bodyguards of Duop. The government equivocally insists they were “in conflict with the law”.
However, the peace monitors described the arbitrary arrest and detention of opposition figures as one of the factors which have significantly held back the progress of the agreement implementation.
“During the quarter, implementation of the Agreement ground to a halt, as the Parties engaged in repeated violations and the political and security environment markedly worsened,” says RJMEC.
“In scenes not seen since the signing of the R-ARCSS over six years ago, armed conflict and violence erupted across the country, several high-ranking opposition members and Parliamentarians were detained and imprisoned, and the First Vice President Dr Riek Machar Teny was put under house arrest,” the report reiterates.
The 2025 quarterly report also noted that some ministerial positions at the state and national levels and those within the Presidency were reshuffled, and portfolios within some agreement institutions and mechanisms were abandoned.
Since political tensions began in early March, several members of the SPLM-IO have fled the country for safety. Among the high-profile officials is Mr Oyet Nathaniel Pierino, the First Deputy Speaker of Parliament and the party’s Deputy Chairman.",https://www.sudanspost.com/rjmec-orders-urgent-release-of-opposition-detainees/,sudanspost.com,"Mon, 28 Apr 2025 10:27:55 GMT"
South Sudan government considers replacing Riek Machar - Radio Tamazuj,The revitalized transitional government in South Sudan revealed the possibility of replacing First Vice President Dr. Riek Machar.,"South Sudan's revitalized transitional government has revealed the possibility of replacing First Vice President Dr. Riek Machar, who has been placed under house arrest in Juba following an investigation into his alleged involvement in violence in Nasir County.

Earlier this month, a faction of SPLM-IO officials announced the appointment of Stephen Far Kuol as the movement's interim leader, following Machar's arrest last March.

Machar was placed under house arrest in Juba following armed clashes between the army and members of the White Army in Nasir County, Upper Nile State, which resulted in the deaths of dozens of soldiers, including their commander.

However, Awet Nathaniel, Machar's deputy, had suspended Far Kuol, the Minister of Peacebuilding, and four others, prior to his appointment, accusing him of plotting to oust Riek Machar from the leadership of the movement.

Michael Kuei Lueth, the Minister of Information, said at a press conference in Juba on Saturday that Machar's position could be vacant if investigators find sufficient evidence against him. He indicated that if the committee finds evidence, it will recommend Machar's prosecution.

McKuei, a member of the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) led by Salva Kiir, added that if the investigations lead to a trial, the committee will advise the president to dismiss Machar.

He did not disclose the composition of the investigation committee or its timeline, but emphasized the need for Machar to be formally removed before he can be tried for the violence in Nasir, which he said resulted in hundreds of deaths.

He continued, ""He cannot be tried while he is still the first vice president. He must be removed from his position to face the law. If the investigations do not find any evidence, he will be released.""

He stressed that Machar's arrest does not derail the 2018 peace agreement or the general elections scheduled for December 2024.

He continued, ""Riek Machar is a leader, but his conflict with the law is something else. His arrest does not mean the collapse of the Sudan People's Liberation Movement-in-Opposition. The movement continues, and the faction in government remains committed to the agreement.""

He pointed out that the Sudan People's Liberation Movement-in-Opposition has split into four factions, with only one faction now supporting the peace agreement.

For his part, civil society activist Ter Manyang, executive director of the Center for Peace Advocacy, said that Article 1.7.2 of the revitalized agreement stipulates that Riek Machar is the first vice president of the republic during the transitional period.

He warned that unilaterally replacing Machar risks repeating the 2016 crisis, when the appointment of Taban Deng Gai led to renewed fighting. He indicated that the move may be accepted by the opposition army generals, and that the government must handle this matter carefully to avoid war.",https://www.radiotamazuj.org/ar/news/article/%d8%ad%d9%83%d9%88%d9%85%d8%a9-%d8%ac%d9%86%d9%88%d8%a8-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%b3%d9%88%d8%af%d8%a7%d9%86-%d8%aa%d8%af%d8%b1%d8%b3-%d8%a5%d9%85%d9%83%d8%a7%d9%86%d9%8a%d8%a9-%d8%aa%d8%a8%d8%af%d9%8a%d9%84,radiotamazuj.org,"Mon, 28 Apr 2025 10:06:51 GMT"
Opposition General: South Sudan is on the verge of collapse - Radio Tamazuj,A senior official opposed to Salva Kiir's government warned on Friday that South Sudan's government is facing a crisis.,"A senior official opposed to Salva Kiir's government warned on Friday that the South Sudanese government is facing a legitimacy crisis and is at risk of political collapse, citing declining international support and the arming of civilians amid rising tensions among the country's top leaders.

The warning by General Oyay Deng Ajak, a prominent opposition figure within the Sudan People's Liberation Movement-National Army (SPLM-N), comes weeks after an unannounced meeting in Uganda between Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, South Sudan's Vice President Rebecca Nyandeng de Mabior, and opposition officials, including Oyay.

According to sources, the discussions focused on the political transition and a succession plan for South Sudan's leadership, but the meeting ended without a final agreement.

The security and political situation in South Sudan threatens to plunge the country back into war.

In a statement seen by Radio Tamazuj, General Oyay Deng, a founding member of the SPLM and former Minister of Security, accused Salva Kiir's government of pushing the country toward chaos.

He said, ""The current government has failed to represent the sovereignty of our people, and we must form an inclusive government that reflects the will of our citizens before it is too late.""

The statement pointed to South Sudan's declining global standing, including the United States' plan to close its embassy in Juba and the withdrawal of some European diplomats.

""The regime has lost credibility domestically and internationally, and we cannot move forward while even our closest partners turn their backs on us,"" he continued.

He also warned of the threat posed by tribal militias and the weakness of the national army, saying that arming civilians risks deepening conflict. ""We must discourage tribal armies and build a national army that represents all communities, otherwise we will lose the nation we fought for,"" he said.

General Oyay Deng recalled South Sudan's struggle for independence and urged unity among leaders and citizens. ""We cannot allow the sacrifices of our martyrs to be wasted. It is time to renew our commitment to South Sudan or risk losing everything,"" he said.

AFRICA - Pope Francis's relentless quest for peace in the face of African conflicts,"by Luca MainoldiRome – Two images immediately come to mind to describe Pope Francis's action in Africa. The first is that of Pope Francis, at the Casa Santa Marta, kissing the feet of South Sudanese President Salva Kiir Mayardit and the vice-presidents-designate present, including Riek Machar, the former's historic rival, and Rebecca Nyandeng De Mabio. It was April 11, 2019. With this moving gesture, at the end of a two-day spiritual retreat attended by the civil and ecclesiastical authorities of the African country, Pope Francis seems to have ""denied himself"" to ask, on behalf of the populations who are victims of the war decided by the powerful, to stop, to give peace a chance. The Holy Father accompanied this gesture with the following words: To the three of you who signed the peace agreement, allow me to make this request to you, as a brother: make peace.",,https://www.fides.org/fr/news/76298-AFRIQUE_La_quete_incessante_de_paix_du_Pape_Francois_face_aux_conflits_africains,fides.org,"Mon, 28 Apr 2025 09:17:46 GMT"

"Machar's SPLM-IO accuses gov’t of ethnic profiling, threatens ICC action – Sudans Post","South Sudan's main opposition Sudan People’s Liberation Movement in Opposition (SPLM-IO), led by First Vice President Riek Machar, who is currently detained, has accused the government of systematic ethnic profiling and threatened to file cases of human rights violations at the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague.","In a statement issued on Sunday, the group’s acting chairman Oyet Nathaniel Pierino accused the government of “ethnic profiling” of the Nuer community and detailed other grievances regarding the implementation of the peace agreement.


Acting SPLM-IO leader Oyet Nathaniel Pierino. [Photo courtesy]JUBA – South Sudan’s main opposition Sudan People’s Liberation Movement in Opposition (SPLM-IO), led by First Vice President Riek Machar, who is currently detained, has accused the government of systematic ethnic profiling and threatened to file cases of human rights violations at the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague.
The accusations follow statements made on Saturday in the capital Juba by a senior government official, Martin Elia Lomuro, cabinet minister and secretary of the government High-level Standing Committee on peace implementation.
Lomuro, speaking alongside information minister Michael Makuei Lueth stated that nine of the sixteen counties predominantly inhabited by the Nuer ethnic group are “hostile” areas to the government, while seven were deemed “friendly.” The “hostile” categorization was based on the perceived alignment of these areas with the SPLM-IO, which is mainly supported by the Nuer.
Leer county, Machar’s home area, was among those labeled “friendly.”
In a statement issued on Sunday, the group’s acting chairman Oyet Nathaniel Pierino accused the government of “ethnic profiling” of the Nuer community and detailed other grievances regarding the implementation of the peace agreement.
“We are also disappointed to note that, paragraph two (2) of the ‘Strategic Response’ described the Nuer ethnic group as one of the largest in South Sudan inhabiting sixteen (16) Counties, nine (9) of which were considered by the SPLM-IG and security agents as ‘hostile’ and aligned with SPLM/SPLA-IO while the remaining seven (7) Counties are deemed ‘friendly’ as they are perceived to be aligned with the SPLM-IG,” Oyet stated.
In October 2015, an African Union Commission of Inquiry found widespread targeting of Nuer civilians in Juba during the December 2013 outbreak of violence. Oyet stated in his statement that the government’s categorization of Nuer community counties as “hostile” recalls the events of December 2013, the initial phase of the conflict between President Salva Kiir, an ethnic Dinka, and his former deputy Machar, an ethnic Nuer.
“The SPLM/SPLA-IO is not surprised by this ethnic profiling since in December 2013, at the onset of the conflict and as highlighted by ‘the Final Report of the African Union Commission of Inquiry on South Sudan’ of 15th October 2014, paragraph 464, which states that: ‘Juba was subdivided into four operation sectors…paragraph 810, states: ‘…Roadblocks or checkpoints were established all around Juba and house-to-house searches were undertaken by security forces. During this operation, male Nuers were targeted, identified, killed on the spot or gathered in one place and killed,’” Oyet quoted from the AU report.
“We warn and strongly condemn this perpetuation of State Policy of ethnic and tribal profiling, targeting, and cleansing,” he added.
Citing the alleged lack of credible accountability mechanisms within South Sudan, the SPLM-IO announced that it is making consultations for formation of a committee to pursue an intention to pursue justice internationally including filing a case before the ICC.
“The SPLM/SPLA-IO would like to make it known that, in lieu of the absence of competent and credible mechanisms for justice and accountability in South Sudan and pursuant to Chapter Five (5) of the R-ARCSS on Transitional Justice, Accountability, reconciliation and hailing, we are hereby commencing widespread consultation within our structures and other partners with the view of forming a taskforce for the purposes of filing cases of Human Rights Violations, Atrocities, War Crimes, Crimes against Peace, Crimes against Humanity, and Genocides with the International Criminal Court (ICC) at the Hague, and we vow to remain seized of the matter,” he said.
The involvement of ethnic militias has been a key factor in the complexity and perpetuation of South Sudan’s conflict. While these groups have not articulated distinct political objectives, both government and opposition forces have leveraged them for military advantage, exacerbating ethnic divisions during the civil war.
In the context of the Upper Nile fighting, the government has linked the White Army to the command structure of the SPLM-IO. Addressing these accusations, Oyet highlighted the militia’s existence before the December 2013 crisis that ignited the major phase of the county’s first civil war as a nation.
“Paragraph four (4) of the ‘Strategic Response’ regarding the relationship between the SPLM/SPLA-IO and the White Army, we would like to highlight that the White Army existed before the December 2013 crisis,” he said.
“The White Army are armed youth just like any other in South Sudan; Abushok in Baliet County, Agwelek in Fashoda area, the Murle armed youth in Greater Pibor, the armed youth in Eastern, Central, and Western Equatoria States, and the armed youth in Bahr El Ghazel (Mathiang Anyor, Gelweng, Tit-bai, Dut-ku-Beny), etc,” Oyet added, highlighting the prevalence of such community-based armed groups.
While noting the White Army’s past alignment with the SPLM-IO during the 2013-2018 civil war, Oyet stated that their involvement in the initial 2013 violence was a response to government actions in Juba.
“In December 2013, the White Army reacted to the Nuer massacre in Juba by the Government supported by the armed youth from Bahr El Ghazel drawn from Mathiang Anyor, Gelweng, Tit-bai, Dut-ku-Beny. They fought with the combined forces of the SPLA, NSS, Police, Wildlife, Prison, and the UPDF in Jonglei State when they threatened to march to Juba. The SPLM/SPLA-IO was not yet formed at the time. Therefore, the White Army is capable of reacting independently to any situation in their area or elsewhere in the Country,” he stated.
Local residents in Nasir have long experienced friction with the SSPDF, which they accuse of atrocities including rape and looting. In early March, fighting erupted in Nasir, resulting in local youth capturing the SSPDF brigade headquarters in Wec Ayar and killing the commander during a UN evacuation effort. Numerous SSPDF soldiers were either killed or fled the area.
Following this fighting, Gabriel Duop Lam, the SPLA-IO military chief of staff who also serves as the deputy Chief of Defence Forces of the SSPDF as part of the peace implementation, was arrested by security forces. Petroleum Minister Puot Kang Chuol and Peacebuilding Minister Par Kuol, who now leads a faction of the SPLM-IO not widely recognized by the group’s membership, were also arrested, with only Kuol being released a day later.
As tensions escalated, Ugandan forces, who fought alongside Kiir during the 2013-2018 conflict, were subsequently deployed in South Sudan. Ugandan warplanes dropped ethyl acetate, a flammable chemical compound, that caused fires and resulted in dozens of civilian casualties, including the death of a prominent community chief.
Uganda has maintained a military presence and influence in South Sudan with varying justifications over the course of the conflict. Machar was arrested on March 26, days after he wrote to protest the Ugandan army deployment in the country.
Following Machar’s detention, the SPLM-IO accused the SSPDF, supported by the Ugandan air force, of initiating attacks on opposition cantonment sites and bases in Central Equatoria, including areas near Juba.
Oyet also criticized the government’s failure to fully implement the security arrangements outlined in the revitalized peace agreement, which he said had contributed to the recent clashes with the White Army in Nasir and Ulang, both areas under SPLM/SPLA-IO control according to the power-sharing deal.
“Nasir and Ulang are being targeted because they are among the SPLM/SPLA-IO controlled areas notwithstanding the Peace process which allocated Responsibilities Sharing in the Country. The Transitional Security Arrangements, which was to be completed within eight (8) months of the Pre-transitional Period, imposed limitations on the movement and deployment of troops except for the Necessary Unified Forces (NUF) in the Country,” Oyet stated.
“The SSPDF, and affiliated militias of Abushok, Agwelek, and the UPDF contravened the provisions of the Transitional Security Arrangements (TSA) including CoHA 2017, and the Permanent Ceasefire and this was the flashpoint between the SSPDF and the White Army, hence the confrontation,” he added.",https://www.sudanspost.com/machars-splm-io-accuses-govt-of-ethnic-profiling-threatens-icc-action/,sudanspost.com,"Mon, 28 Apr 2025 06:56:28 GMT"

Immer wieder müssen Südsudanesen und Südsudanesinnen vor Kämpfen flüchten.
Florian Gaertner / Imago

Seit der Staatsgründung im Jahr 2011 war es im Südsudan nie ganz friedlich. Der siebenjährige Bürgerkrieg endete 2018 mit einem Machtteilungsabkommen der beiden wichtigsten Ethnien, der Dinka und der Nuer. Doch auch seither bricht lokal immer wieder Gewalt aus.

In mehreren Teilen des Landes kämpfen Regierungstruppen gegen Rebellenmilizen, Anfang März wurde ein Helikopter der Uno abgeschossen. Präsident Salva Kiir, der den Dinka angehört, liess seinen Vizepräsidenten Machar verhaften, der den Nuer angehört. Die Uno warnt davor, dass im Südsudan wieder ein offener Krieg ausbrechen könnte. Wie lässt sich das verhindern?

Eine Hoffnung beruht auf lokalen Gerichten, die zur Stabilisierung des Landes beitragen können. Eine andere, dass sich die Bevölkerung schlicht weigert, erneut in einen Krieg zu ziehen.

Gerichte unter den Bäumen
Im Südsudan, einem der weltweit am wenigsten entwickelten Staaten, gibt es nur wenige Juristen, aber viele Richter. Die meisten Konflikte werden an Chief-Courts beigelegt, lokalen Gerichten, die ohne hohe Hürden Fälle aus den umliegenden Dörfern beurteilen. Zur Verhandlung treffen sich fünf bis sieben Chiefs sowie alle, die zuhören wollen. Meist tagen die Gerichte unter Bäumen oder behelfsmässigen Unterständen. Entschieden wird über alle möglichen Dinge, es geht um Streitigkeiten wegen Ziegen, Konflikte wegen Grundstückgrenzen, um Ehebruch oder Mord.

Die Chiefs urteilen nach Brauchtum, Tradition und Ethik. Ein einheitliches formales Recht, wie es europäischer Rechtsprechung zugrunde liegt, gibt es auf dieser lokalen Ebene nicht. Trotzdem sind diese Gerichte wichtig. Martina Santschi, Expertin für den Südsudan bei der Stiftung Swisspeace sagt: «Die Chief-Courts können verhindern, dass aus einem Streit Gewalt wird.»

Im Südsudan werden Konflikte über Kompensation gelöst. So heisst es etwa: Stiehlst du mir eine Kuh, muss ich dir fünf zurückgeben. Findet diese Kompensation nicht statt, kann es zu Selbstjustiz kommen. Santschi sagt: «Seit dem Ende des letzten Bürgerkriegs starben viele Menschen wegen Konflikten auf lokaler Ebene.»

Können die Chiefs einen Streit nicht schlichten, wird das besonders heikel, wenn der Streit entlang ethnischer Linien entbrennt. Aus einem Einzelfall kann rasch eine Gruppenangelegenheit werden – und daraus ethnische Gewalt.

Die Chiefs, die ihr Dorf entwaffnen
Viele lokale Chiefs engagieren sich in Friedensinitiativen, arbeiten mit der Kirche und höheren staatlichen Ebenen zusammen und versuchen so, Gewalt zu verhindern. Um einen neuen Krieg zu verhindern, sagt die Südsudan-Expertin Santschi, reichten die Chiefs alleine nicht. Sie könnten aber, gerade weil sie in ihren Dörfern eine Autorität sind und von der Bevölkerung respektiert werden, eine wichtige Rolle einnehmen. Manchen ist es in den vergangenen Jahren gelungen, ihre Gemeinschaft zu entwaffnen. Ein Chief aus dem Norden des Südsudans, Abakar Salathin Decak, sagt in einem Film: «Wir Chiefs mögen Spannungen, Kämpfe oder den Tod nicht.»

Die Kehrseite davon, dass die Chiefs es als Aufgabe sehen, den Zusammenhalt einer Gemeinschaft zu wahren: Die Rechte der Einzelnen können verletzt werden. So kann es vorkommen, dass vergewaltigte Frauen den Täter heiraten müssen – um den Zusammenhalt der Gemeinschaft nicht zu gefährden.

Wenn ein Konflikt in kriegerische Gewalt eskaliert, kann die Autorität der Chiefs auch missbraucht werden. Zum Beispiel dann, wenn sie von der Regierung in deren Interesse eingesetzt werden. Andere Chiefs werden von Milizen erpresst, bedroht und auch gefoltert, damit sie Männer aus der Gemeinschaft in den Krieg schicken. Diese Männer fehlen nachher im sozialen Gefüge des Dorfes, was zu neuer Instabilität und zu Konflikten führen kann.

Dieses Risiko steigt gerade wieder an, weil auch der Südsudan vom Wegfall der Hilfsgelder aus den USA schwer getroffen wird. Mit der Armut steigt die Bereitschaft, sich einer Miliz anzuschliessen. Wo Geld für das Allernötigste fehlt, kann der Kriegsdienst als Ausweg gesehen werden.

Können die Chiefs diese Entwicklung hin zum Krieg stoppen? Alleine wahrscheinlich nicht, sagt Martina Santschi. Sie beobachtet aber, dass immer weniger Menschen im Südsudan schon wieder in den Krieg ziehen wollen. So besteht zumindest eine kleine Chance, dass der Ausbruch eines Krieges doch noch verhindert werden kann.",https://www.nzz.ch/international/im-suedsudan-steigen-die-spannungen-koennen-lokale-chiefs-das-land-stabilisieren-ld.1877089,nzz.ch,"Mon, 28 Apr 2025 03:30:00 GMT"
Lawmaker claims South Sudan plotting genocide against Nuer,A South Sudan opposition lawmaker accuses the government of planning genocide against the Nuer community as ethnic tensions threaten peace efforts.,"A South Sudan opposition lawmaker on Sunday accused President Salva Kiir’s government of preparing a genocide against the Nuer people.



Reath Muoch Tang, a senior figure in Vice President Riek Machar’s party, denounced the labeling of Nuer homelands as “hostile” territories.



He warned that this classification, targeting nine out of sixteen Nuer-majority counties, was a “deliberate and calculated” move towards ethnic cleansing.



Tang described the government’s action as “reckless and malicious,” accusing it of laying the groundwork for mass violence against civilians.



Tensions have soared following the arrest of Machar in March and months of clashes that threaten to plunge South Sudan back into civil war.



Nasir County, a key battleground, was among those deemed hostile, sparking outrage from Machar’s camp and fears of wider bloodshed.



Oyet Nathaniel Pierino, acting party chairman, cited a 2014 African Union report documenting previous atrocities committed against Nuer men.



He condemned the “perpetuation of State Policy” involving ethnic profiling, promising to pursue charges of genocide at the International Criminal Court.



Recent violence in Nasir saw around 6,000 White Army fighters storm a military camp, leaving a top general and hundreds of soldiers dead.



The government, backed by Ugandan forces, claims to have regained control of Nasir and Ulang amid escalating hostilities.



The United Nations reports at least 200 deaths and the displacement of 125,000 civilians since March, worsening South Sudan’s humanitarian crisis.

"South Sudan nearing collapse, opposition official warns - Radio Tamazuj","South Sudan’s government is facing a crisis of legitimacy and risks political collapse, a senior","South Sudan’s government is facing a crisis of legitimacy and risks political collapse, a senior rebel official warned on Friday, citing eroding international support and the militarization of civilians amid escalating tensions between the country’s top leaders.


The warning from General Oyai Deng Ajak, a key opposition figure loosely aligned with the holdout Real SPLM faction, comes weeks after an unannounced meeting in Uganda between Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, South Sudan’s Vice President Rebecca Nyandeng de Mabior, and opposition officials, including Oyai.


Discussions reportedly focused on a political transition and succession plan for South Sudan’s leadership, but the meeting ended without a final agreement.


The country now teeters on the brink of renewed violence as tensions rise between President Salva Kiir and First Vice President Riek Machar, who was placed under house arrest in Juba on March 26.


Kiir’s faction has signaled it may oust Machar—who holds his position under a 2018 power-sharing deal—accusing him of involvement in recent clashes in Nasir. There, the White Army, a Nuer youth militia, attacked an army garrison, killing several soldiers, including commander General David Majur Dak.


In a statement seen by Radio Tamazuj, Gen. Ajak—a founding member of the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement/Army (SPLM/A) and former security minister—accused Kiir’s government of driving the nation toward chaos.


“The current government has failed to represent the sovereignty of our people,” Ajak said. “We must establish an inclusive government that reflects the will of our citizens—before it’s too late.”


His remarks highlight frustration over tribal divisions and a stalled peace process more than a decade after independence in 211.


Ajak cited South Sudan’s deteriorating global standing, including a U.S. plan to shut its Juba embassy and withdrawals by some European diplomats.


“The regime has lost credibility locally and internationally,” he said. “How can we progress when even our closest partners are turning away?”


He also warned of growing tribal militia threats and a weakening national army, saying arming civilians risks deeper conflict.


“We must discourage tribal armies and build a national army representing all communities,” he wrote. “Otherwise, we will lose the nation we fought to create.”


Violence has surged in Upper Nile State, further destabilizing the country.


Invoking South Sudan’s independence struggle, Gen. Ajak urged unity among leaders and citizens.


“We cannot let the sacrifices of our martyrs be squandered,” he said. “It is time to recommit to South Sudan—or risk losing everything.”


The government has not responded to Ajak’s statement.",https://www.radiotamazuj.org/en/news/article/south-sudan-nearing-collapse-opposition-official-warns,radiotamazuj.org,"Sun, 27 Apr 2025 19:36:29 GMT"
South Sudan Opposition MP Accuses Government of Genocide,A South Sudanese opposition MP has accused the government of planning genocide against the Nuer community by labelling their homelands as 'hostile'...,"A South Sudanese opposition lawmaker has accused President Salva Kiir’s government of orchestrating a “genocide” against the Nuer ethnic group by classifying their regions as “hostile.” 



The claim, made on Sunday, comes amid escalating tensions following months of clashes between forces loyal to Kiir and those aligned with First Vice-President Riek Machar, who was arrested in March.



The fragile peace agreement signed in 2018, which ended a brutal civil war that left around 400,000 people dead, now appears increasingly at risk. 



Allegations of unrest fomented by Machar’s faction, particularly in Nasir County in Upper Nile State, have been cited by Kiir’s allies as a threat to that accord. 



In a government statement, officials noted that nine out of 16 Nuer-majority counties were now considered hostile, a designation based on suspected support for Machar’s party.






Reath Muoch Tang, a prominent Nuer politician within Machar’s party, condemned the classification as reckless and dangerous. 



He warned that the labelling of entire communities as hostile amounted to a deliberate plan to justify violence and collective punishment against the Nuer people. 



Tang described it as a “sinister plan” that effectively amounted to mapping out a genocide, accusing the government of seeking to destroy an entire society under the guise of security operations.



Recent clashes around Nasir, where approximately 6,000 White Army fighters reportedly attacked a military base, have significantly heightened tensions. 



The government claims 400 soldiers were killed during the assault, including a senior general. 



Since March, violent confrontations have left at least 200 people dead across several states and displaced around 125,000 individuals, according to UN estimates.



President Kiir, a member of the Dinka ethnic group, has tightened his grip on power by placing Machar under house arrest, further straining relations between the country’s two largest ethnic communities.

The Chief of Staff of the Army orders the removal of all illegal checkpoints on the Nile River - Radio Tamazuj,"The Commander of the South Sudan People's Defence Forces, Lt. Gen. Paul Nang Majok, ordered the removal of all checkpoints.","The Commander of the South Sudan People's Defense Forces (SSPD), Lt. Gen. Paul Nang Majok, has ordered the immediate removal of all illegal checkpoints along the Nile River, stretching from Juba in Central Equatoria State to Malakal in Upper Nile State.

However, some observers warn that implementing this directive may be difficult, as some checkpoints are reportedly controlled by forces loyal to the Sudan People's Liberation Movement-In Opposition (SPLM-IO), an opposition group led by First Vice President Riek Machar, who is currently detained in Juba.

The exact number of unauthorized checkpoints along the Nile remains unclear, as does the timing of this order, which comes amid escalating security tensions between the SPDF and the SPLM-IO.

In January, attempts to dismantle illegal checkpoints along major highways in Western Bahr el Ghazal and Western Equatoria states sparked clashes between the two factions, further straining their fragile relations.

South Sudan has yet to fully unify its military, as stipulated in the 2018 Revitalized Peace Agreement.

The agreement has faced setbacks, including stalled security reforms, delayed election planning, and disagreements between President Salva Kiir and Machar—tensions that led to Machar's arrest last month.

SPDF spokesperson Lul Ruai Koang announced the new checkpoint removal order on Friday, saying the operation would target unauthorized checkpoints that disrupt river transport and trade.

General Koang explained that Lt. Gen. Thep Gatluak Tai Tai, Commander of Ground Forces, and Lt. Gen. Johnson Olony, Assistant Chief of Staff for Mobilization and Disarmament, would lead the operation.

“The removal operation will start from Juba, Juba County, Central Equatoria State, and continue to Malakal Town, Makal County, Upper Nile State,” Koang said.

He emphasized that the operation aims to promote trade, reduce illegal taxation, and improve the safety and efficiency of river transport. Lieutenant General Stephen Babanin, head of military intelligence, has been tasked with overseeing the implementation.

This move appears to be in line with broader government efforts to revive economic activity along the Nile River, a vital trade route.

However, doubts remain about its feasibility in some areas.

Ter Manyang Gatwech, executive director of the Peace and Advocacy Center, questioned the feasibility of the order, noting that opposition forces control some checkpoints.

“I don’t think it will be effective, although it’s a good step, because people are concerned about what’s happening in the country,” Gatwech said.

“The SPLA-IO may not agree to this, because this is the same thing that has brought problems to the country. I remember when the current chief of staff disagreed with his deputy over this before he was arrested.”",https://www.radiotamazuj.org/ar/news/article/%d9%82%d8%a7%d8%a6%d8%af-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%ac%d9%8a%d8%b4-%d9%8a%d8%a3%d9%85%d8%b1-%d8%a8%d8%a5%d8%b2%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%a9-%d8%ac%d9%85%d9%8a%d8%b9-%d9%86%d9%82%d8%a7%d8%b7-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%aa%d9%81%d8%aa,radiotamazuj.org,"Sun, 27 Apr 2025 15:49:05 GMT"
Three people killed and seven others injured in a raid on livestock in Ruweng - Radio Tamazuj,At least three people were killed and seven others injured on Thursday in an attack on a cattle camp.,"At least three people were killed and seven others injured on Thursday in an attack on a cattle camp in Ruweng Administrative Area by youth suspected of belonging to Unity State.

The Ruweng government condemned the attack on the Athoni cattle camp and a South Sudan People's Defense Forces (SSPD) garrison, describing it as a ""barbaric"" act by heavily armed militias.

Simon Chol Mayalith, Ruweng's Minister of Information, Culture, Youth, and Sports, stated that the attackers stole more than 5,000 cattle, although 4,548 were later recovered with the help of security forces.

Ruweng County authorities denied claims by Unity State officials that all the cattle had been returned.

Among the dead was a SSPD officer. The wounded were taken to Juba for treatment.

Unity State authorities called for the recovery of the remaining cattle and for those responsible to be held accountable. Officials also urged peaceful coexistence among the communities.

“The boat split in half mid-river and sank, carrying all the humanitarian food aid. It was a huge loss, especially given the urgent needs of communities awaiting supplies,” he said.

He revealed that a rescue team was dispatched from Bor shortly after the incident, but the boat had already sunk when they arrived at the scene.

Tengbor confirmed that all crew members and passengers on board survived the accident, adding that authorities are investigating the causes of the accident and that efforts are underway to assess the extent of the damage.

The UN has yet to issue an official statement.

This incident raises new concerns about the safety of river transport in South Sudan, especially during the rainy season when water levels and currents are significantly reduced.",https://www.radiotamazuj.org/ar/news/article/%d8%a7%d9%86%d9%82%d9%84%d8%a7%d8%a8-%d9%82%d8%a7%d8%b1%d8%a8-%d9%8a%d8%ad%d9%85%d9%84-%d9%85%d8%b3%d8%a7%d8%b9%d8%af%d8%a7%d8%aa-%d8%a5%d9%86%d8%b3%d8%a7%d9%86%d9%8a%d8%a9-%d9%81%d9%8a-%d9%88%d9%84,radiotamazuj.org,"Sun, 27 Apr 2025 14:53:55 GMT"
Ngok Dinka clans organize a cultural event - Radio Tamazuj,The nine Ngok Dinka clans in the Abyei Administration organized a one-day event in Abyei town on Thursday.,"On Thursday, the nine Ngok Dinka clans in the Abyei Administrative Area organized a one-day event in Abyei town to revive their cultural values.

The Ministry of Culture, Youth, and Sports in the area organized the event with support from local communities under the theme ""Restoring Abyei's Cultural Values.""

Local officials stated that their culture condemns violence between the nine clans and their neighbors, but that current attitudes, unfortunately, encourage violence.

Bulbek Deng Kuol, the paramount chief of Abyei, described this cultural event as pivotal in educating youth against adopting and practicing negative foreign cultures, which he describes as harmful.

He added, ""Abyei's authentic culture was eroded during successive wars when Sudan was still a single country, and young people were scattered to different parts of the world, returning with alien lifestyles. This created a significant gap with our traditional values ​​and cultures, as young people acquired cultures different from those of our ancestors.""

Chief Deng stated, ""The current generation will pass on the dance styles, customs, and lifestyle of the community that they learned from previous generations through messages and songs.""

Meanwhile, Victor Bol Dau, Director General of the Ministry of Culture, Youth, and Sports in Abyei, said that they organized this event with financial support from the community to preserve the cultural heritage of the area.

He explained, ""This event was not funded by the Abyei Area Government or NGOs; it is a community initiative.""

Bau added, ""It is astonishing now that young people disrespect their elders and constantly quarrel with their neighbors. These things are not allowed in our culture.""

He emphasized the importance of this cultural performance in changing the minds of young people, ensuring a better future that embraces education and development.

He added, ""Marriage costs were exorbitant in the past, and a man would need to pay at least 120 head of cattle to marry someone's daughter, so parents encouraged their sons to work hard. Today, a man can marry a woman for between 20 and 40 cows, which has made young men lazy, even participating in cattle raids.""

According to Paul, the cultural event sent a message from the sultans to young people to adopt good morals, behave appropriately in society, and avoid provocation.",https://www.radiotamazuj.org/ar/news/article/%d8%b9%d8%b4%d8%a7%d8%a6%d8%b1-%d8%af%d9%8a%d9%86%d9%83%d8%a7-%d9%86%d9%82%d9%88%d9%83-%d9%8a%d9%86%d8%b8%d9%85%d9%88%d9%86-%d9%81%d8%b9%d8%a7%d9%84%d9%8a%d8%a9-%d8%ab%d9%82%d8%a7%d9%81%d9%8a%d8%a9,radiotamazuj.org,"Sun, 27 Apr 2025 14:48:47 GMT"
